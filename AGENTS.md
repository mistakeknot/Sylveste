# Demarch — Agent Development Guide

Open-source autonomous software development agency platform (Intercore, Clavain, Interverse, Autarch, Interspect).

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                                  # See available work
git rev-parse --show-toplevel             # Verify which repo you're in
cd interverse/<name> && uv run pytest tests/structural/ -v  # Plugin tests
cd core/intercore && go test ./...        # Kernel tests
ic publish --patch                        # Publish plugin (Go CLI)
scripts/bump-version.sh <ver>             # Publish plugin (shell)
bd close <id> && bd sync && git push      # Complete work
```

## Session Close Protocol

1. File beads for remaining work (`bd create`)
2. Run quality gates (tests, linters, builds)
3. Close/update beads (`bd close <id>`)
4. **Push** — `git pull --rebase && bd sync && git push`
5. Verify `git status` shows "up to date with origin"

Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds. See [agents/session-protocol.md](agents/session-protocol.md) for full details.
