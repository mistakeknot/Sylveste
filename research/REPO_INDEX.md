# Research Repo Index

Generated: 2026-02-28 (post-triage)

Owner: `Dicklesworthstone`

## Summary

- Owner repos discovered: 170 (original scan 2026-02-27)
- Kept after triage: 28 (score >= 85, relevance: integration or both)
- Removed: 142 (low relevance to Sylveste)
- Disk reclaimed: ~4.4 GB (6.6 GB → 1.9 GB)

## Triage Criteria

Repos kept if: **score >= 85** AND **relevance_type in (integration, both)**. Scores from automated triage pipeline (`docs/research/dicklesworthstone-repo-triage-2026-02-27.csv`). Detailed assessments for top repos in `docs/research/assess-*.md`.

## Integration Philosophy

Do not replicate fully developed external projects. Adopt tools directly (e.g., `dcg` as a hook), port specific patterns/packages into Sylveste's codebase, or take design inspiration. See `MEMORY.md` → "External Repos — Integration Philosophy".
