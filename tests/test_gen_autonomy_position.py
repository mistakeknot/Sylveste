"""Coverage for gen-autonomy-position.py's rendering and splice.

The generator's real job runs where the monorepo is materialised: it reads a
live kernel and a live streak counter. Neither exists on a cloud runner, because
the monorepo .gitignore's core/ and os/. So what CI can check is the half that
does not need them — given two source readings, does the block say the right
thing, and does splicing it into the canon page leave everything else alone.

The half CI cannot check is guarded instead: `--check` must exit 2 on a
source-less checkout rather than comparing an "unavailable" block against an
"unavailable" block and reporting success. That assertion lives in
.github/workflows/kimi-manifest-drift.yml, next to the identical guard for the
Kimi manifests, whose absence let 21 of them drift.
