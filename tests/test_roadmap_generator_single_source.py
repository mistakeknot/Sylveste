"""The roadmap generator has exactly one implementation, and it is interpath's.

Two copies of sync-roadmap-json.sh existed for four months and diverged in four
ways at once: the plugin copy counted all 18 deferred beads as open work
(481 -> 499), hardcoded blocked_by to [] and dropped 127 dependency edges,
emitted a timestamp that is malformed on macOS because %:z is a GNU date
extension, and produced no backlog.md at all.

None of that was invisible for lack of tests. tests/test_render_backlog.py had
asserted every one of those behaviours since July. It just only ever ran the
monorepo copy, so the implementation that was wrong was the one no test could
reach. These tests exist to make a re-fork fail rather than drift.
