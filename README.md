# Demarch

A monorepo for building software with agents, where the review phases matter more than the building phases, and the point is not to remove humans from the loop but to make every moment in the loop count.

Demarch is the platform behind [Clavain](https://github.com/mistakeknot/Clavain), a self-improving Claude Code agent rig that orchestrates the full development lifecycle from brainstorm to ship. It coordinates Claude, Codex, and GPT-5.2 Pro into something more useful than any of them alone.

## Quick start

Install Clavain and the full companion plugin ecosystem in one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mistakeknot/Demarch/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open Claude Code in your project and run:

```
/clavain:project-onboard
```

This sets up beads tracking, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, docs structure, observability, and seeds your first roadmap. After that, use `/clavain:route` to start building.

## What you get

- **Clavain**: the agent rig (brainstorm → strategy → plan → execute → review → ship)
- **40+ companion plugins**: multi-agent code review, phase tracking, doc freshness, semantic search, TUI testing (26 installed by default, 14 optional)
- **Multi-model orchestration**: Claude does the heavy lifting, Codex runs parallel tasks, GPT-5.2 Pro provides a second opinion via Oracle
- **Sprint management**: track work with Beads, auto-discover what to work on next

## How it works

Most agent tools skip the product phases (brainstorm, strategy, specification) and jump straight to code generation. The thinking phases are where the real leverage is. Clavain makes them first-class:

1. **Discover**: scan backlog, surface ready work, recommend next task
2. **Brainstorm**: collaborative dialogue to explore the problem space
3. **Strategize**: structure ideas into a PRD with trackable features
4. **Plan**: write bite-sized implementation tasks with TDD
5. **Execute**: dispatch agents (Claude subagents or Codex) to implement
6. **Review**: multi-agent quality gates catch issues before shipping
7. **Ship**: land the change with verification and session reflection

## Philosophy

Three principles, applied recursively: every action produces evidence, evidence earns authority, and authority is scoped and composed. The cycle compounds — more autonomy produces more data, more data improves routing, better routing cuts cost, lower cost enables more autonomy.

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full design bets, tradeoffs, and convictions.

## Architecture

Demarch is a monorepo with 5 pillars:

| Pillar | Layer | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [Intercore](https://github.com/mistakeknot/intercore) | L1 (Core) | Orchestration kernel: runs, dispatches, gates, events |
| [Clavain](https://github.com/mistakeknot/Clavain) | L2 (OS) | Self-improving agent rig |
| [Interverse](https://github.com/mistakeknot/interagency-marketplace) | L2-L3 | 47 companion plugins |
| [Autarch](https://github.com/mistakeknot/Autarch) | L3 (Apps) | TUI interfaces (Bigend, Gurgeh, Coldwine, Pollard) |
| [Interspect](interverse/interspect/) | L2 | Agent performance profiler and routing optimizer |

Additional infrastructure: [Intermute](https://github.com/mistakeknot/intermute) (multi-agent coordination), [interbase](https://github.com/mistakeknot/interbase) (SDK), [interbench](https://github.com/mistakeknot/interbench), [interband](https://github.com/mistakeknot/interband).

### Plugin ecosystem

All plugins are installed from the [interagency-marketplace](https://github.com/mistakeknot/interagency-marketplace).

### Naming convention

All module names are **lowercase** except **Clavain** (proper noun), **Demarch** (project name), **Interverse** (ecosystem name), and **Autarch** (proper noun).
