# Authz token canonical payload — sig_version=2

This document pins the **exact byte sequence** that Ed25519 signs for each `authz_tokens` row under `sig_version=2`. Signatures depend on byte-for-byte agreement; any deviation in encoding produces non-verifying signatures for correct rows and verifying signatures for tampered rows. This is the spec. Implementations MUST match.

The v1.5 canonical payload (see `docs/canon/authz-signing-payload.md`) governs `sig_version=1` for `authorizations` rows. The two payloads share encoding rules (NFC, LF, no trailing LF, UTF-8, no CR) but have **different field lists**. Distinct `sig_version` values prevent cross-payload replay — a signature produced over a sig_version=1 payload cannot verify as a sig_version=2 payload even if the byte sequences happened to coincide, because the verifier dispatches on `sig_version` before computing the expected payload.

## 1. Field order

Signed fields, in strict order:

```
id
op_type
target
agent_id
bead_id
delegate_to
expires_at
issued_by
parent_token
root_token
depth
created_at
```

12 fields. `consumed_at`, `revoked_at`, `sig_version`, and `signature` are **NOT** part of the signed payload. They are metadata about the token's lifecycle and the signing itself. Excluding them:

- Prevents circular dependency (a signature can't sign itself).
- Allows `consumed_at` and `revoked_at` to mutate after sign without invalidating the signature — by design, since lifecycle transitions are the whole point of token state.
- Allows `sig_version` to change across canonical-payload upgrades without invalidating existing signatures under the prior version.

Do not reorder. A new field requires a new `sig_version` (3, 4, ...) and a parallel signer path; the old path continues to sign using the old field set for backward compatibility.

## 2. Encoding rules

Identical to v1.5 (`docs/canon/authz-signing-payload.md §Encoding rules`), restated here for completeness:

1. **Separator:** a single line feed byte (`\n`, 0x0A) between fields.
2. **Trailing newline:** none. The payload ends with the last field's bytes; no terminator.
3. **NULL representation:** the empty string. A SQL NULL and an empty string in the row both encode as zero bytes at that position.
4. **Unicode normalization:** NFC. All text fields must be NFC-normalized before concatenation. Fields that are strictly hex/int (`id`, `parent_token`, `root_token`) are not text but pass through NFC as a no-op.
5. **Integer formatting:** decimal, no leading zeros, no leading `+`, no thousands separators. `depth`, `expires_at`, `created_at` use their unsigned integer representation (Go `strconv.FormatInt(n, 10)`). Negative values are prohibited by the schema and signer rejects them explicitly.
6. **Forbidden characters:** `\r` (0x0D) and control characters in `[0x00, 0x1F] \ {\n}` are not permitted in any text field. The signer MUST reject rows containing them rather than silently stripping. Strip at insertion time, not at signing time.
7. **Output format:** `Sign()` returns the raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature. Callers that need a text form (e.g., for the opaque `<ulid>.<sighex>` string carried via env var) use lowercase hex (no prefix, no separator). The `signature BLOB` column stores raw bytes.

## 3. Worked examples

Three canonical cases cover the common shapes. Implementations MUST verify their `CanonicalTokenPayload()` function reproduces these byte sequences exactly. A golden-fixture test `TestCanonicalTokenPayload_GoldenFixtures` in `pkg/authz/token_test.go` ships alongside the implementation.

Below, `\n` is shown as the literal two-character sequence for reader clarity; real bytes are single LF (0x0A).

### Example 1 — Root issue (no delegation)

Row (column → value):

```
id            = "01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B"
op_type       = "bead-close"
target        = "sylveste-qdqr.28"
agent_id      = "claude-opus-4-7"
bead_id       = "sylveste-qdqr.28"
delegate_to   = NULL
expires_at    = 1776742800
issued_by     = "user"
parent_token  = NULL
root_token    = NULL
depth         = 0
created_at    = 1776739200
```

Canonical payload (12 lines joined by `\n`, no trailing newline):

```
01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B\n
bead-close\n
sylveste-qdqr.28\n
claude-opus-4-7\n
sylveste-qdqr.28\n
\n
1776742800\n
user\n
\n
\n
0\n
1776739200
```

Lines 6, 9, 10 are empty strings → zero bytes between their surrounding `\n` delimiters. Line 11 is the literal decimal `0` (not empty; `depth=0` is a real integer value).

### Example 2 — Depth-1 delegation (Claude → codex)

Claude holds the Example 1 token and delegates to codex. The child token is:

```
id            = "01J0GZ8X4M7Q3N8S6XW9Y2Z5CF"
op_type       = "bead-close"                       (same as parent)
target        = "sylveste-qdqr.28"                 (same as parent)
agent_id      = "codex"                             (the delegate recipient)
bead_id       = "sylveste-qdqr.28"                 (copied from parent)
delegate_to   = "codex"                             (explicit delegation marker)
expires_at    = 1776742800                          (clamped to parent's remaining; unchanged here)
issued_by     = "claude-opus-4-7"                   (the delegating agent)
parent_token  = "01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B"        (Example 1's id)
root_token    = "01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B"        (denormalized — parent IS the root, so root = parent.id)
depth         = 1
created_at    = 1776739260
```

Canonical payload:

```
01J0GZ8X4M7Q3N8S6XW9Y2Z5CF\n
bead-close\n
sylveste-qdqr.28\n
codex\n
sylveste-qdqr.28\n
codex\n
1776742800\n
claude-opus-4-7\n
01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B\n
01J0GZ7W93K5PKQ42V7TCMWC2B\n
1\n
1776739260
```

All 12 fields populated. `delegate_to` and `agent_id` are equal (line 4 and line 6) — this is intentional. `agent_id` is "who may present this token" (the authz identity at consume time); `delegate_to` is the delegation marker for audit queries like `SELECT * FROM authz_tokens WHERE delegate_to IS NOT NULL` (returns every delegation event across all chains).

### Example 3 — Publish-scoped root token

Used by `ic publish --patch` after an agent-authored commit passes through a sprint's quality gates. The issuer is the sprint orchestrator; the recipient agent consumes it during publish.

```
id            = "01J0GZ9A7P5R4M2T8YZ6W3X1DH"
op_type       = "ic-publish-patch"
target        = "clavain"                           (plugin slug)
agent_id      = "claude-opus-4-7"                   (the publisher)
bead_id       = "sylveste-qdqr.28"
delegate_to   = NULL
expires_at    = 1776742800
issued_by     = "user"
parent_token  = NULL
root_token    = NULL
depth         = 0
created_at    = 1776739200
```

Canonical payload:

```
01J0GZ9A7P5R4M2T8YZ6W3X1DH\n
ic-publish-patch\n
clavain\n
claude-opus-4-7\n
sylveste-qdqr.28\n
\n
1776742800\n
user\n
\n
\n
0\n
1776739200
```

Same shape as Example 1 (root issue) but with `op_type="ic-publish-patch"` and `target="clavain"` (plugin slug, not a bead id). The `bead_id` scopes the publish approval to the sprint's bead — an attacker who obtained this token cannot use it to publish an unrelated bead's commits because the gate wrapper passes `--expect-op=ic-publish-patch --expect-target=clavain` AND the `ic publish` handler checks `bead_id` matches the publish-target plugin's current sprint bead.

## 4. Why not JSON

Identical rationale to v1.5 (`docs/canon/authz-signing-payload.md §Why not JSON`):

1. **Go map iteration is not stable.** `map[string]any` in Go iterates in pseudo-random order; two `json.Marshal` calls on equivalent maps produce different bytes. Deterministic JSON requires a canonical library (not in stdlib) or manual key sorting.
2. **Number encoding is ambiguous.** `1776739200` vs `1776739200.0` vs `1.7767392e+09` — all valid JSON, different bytes. Signing needs ONE form.
3. **Whitespace is free.** Canonicalizers strip it, but the rule must be spelled out.

A LF-delimited ordered sequence avoids all of this. Spec tight, implementation trivial (`strings.Join(parts, "\n")` after NFC + control-char validation).

## 5. Forbidden deviations

- No trailing newline.
- No BOM.
- No UTF-16 / UTF-32 encodings — UTF-8 only.
- No CRLF. LF only. Inputs with CR must be rejected, not transliterated.
- No field reordering across signer versions. A new field requires a new `sig_version` and a parallel signer path; the old path continues to sign using the old field set for backward compatibility.
- No re-canonicalization of stored fields at sign time. Stored bytes are authoritative. If a field is not NFC-normalized at insertion time, it is likewise not NFC-normalized at sign time (asymmetry forbidden). The v2 schema does not have any field analogous to v1.5's `vetting` JSON blob that requires this caveat — all v2 fields are plain text or integer — but the discipline is stated for uniformity.

## 6. Implementation-level test

A reference-implementation test must verify that all three worked examples, when serialized by the production `CanonicalTokenPayload()` function, produce the exact byte sequences shown (after expanding `\n` literals into single LF bytes). This test ships as `TestCanonicalTokenPayload_GoldenFixtures` in `core/intercore/pkg/authz/token_test.go`.

Implementations that diverge from the golden fixtures are buggy by definition. Do not adjust the golden fixtures to match an implementation bug; adjust the implementation.

## 7. Relationship to sig_version=1 payload

| Aspect | sig_version=1 (authorizations) | sig_version=2 (authz_tokens) |
|---|---|---|
| Field count | 12 | 12 |
| Field list | id, op_type, target, agent_id, bead_id, mode, policy_match, policy_hash, vetted_sha, vetting, cross_project_id, created_at | id, op_type, target, agent_id, bead_id, delegate_to, expires_at, issued_by, parent_token, root_token, depth, created_at |
| Purpose | Audit row signing (record of what happened) | Token signing (capability to act) |
| Contains vetting JSON? | Yes, verbatim bytes | No |
| Key used | Project-wide `.clavain/keys/authz-project.key` | Same (v2 reuses the v1.5 key) |

The field-count coincidence (both 12) is not load-bearing. Shared field names (`id`, `op_type`, `target`, `agent_id`, `bead_id`, `created_at` — 6 of 12) produce identical canonical-payload segments for those positions, but the surrounding fields differ. Cross-payload replay would require an adversary to produce a sig_version=1 row whose canonical payload bytes exactly match a sig_version=2 payload they want to forge — computationally intractable given Ed25519 + the distinct surrounding fields, and the verifier's `sig_version` dispatch means even a hypothetical collision would not be accepted as the wrong type.
