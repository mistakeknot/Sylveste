# Sylveste — Vision

## The Pitch

Sylveste is an open-source autonomous software development agency platform that pushes the frontier on three axes simultaneously: state-of-the-art autonomy, uncompromising quality, and relentless token efficiency.

Most agent systems pick two. Full autonomy with quality? Expensive — you throw tokens at everything and hope the review fleet catches the mess. Autonomy with efficiency? Fast and cheap, but the output is slop. Quality with efficiency? Sure — just keep a human in the loop for every decision, defeating the point.

Sylveste refuses to choose. It orchestrates the full development lifecycle from problem discovery through shipped code, selecting the right model for each task with the discipline, durability, and accountability that shipping real software demands. And it gets cheaper and better every time it runs, because it learns from what happened last time.

Not a coding assistant. Not an AI gateway. Not a framework for calling LLMs. A platform for autonomous agencies that do complex knowledge work with discipline, at a cost that keeps declining. Software engineering is the proving ground; the primitives generalize.

The whole thing is open source.

## Two Brands, One Architecture

Sylveste is the infrastructure. Garden Salon is the experience. Meadowsyn is the bridge.

**Sylveste** (SF register) — the durable kernel, opinionated OS, evidence-based learning loop, and plugin ecosystem that makes AI agent orchestration reliable, composable, and self-improving. For developers and platform builders. Named after Revelation Space.

**Garden Salon** (organic register) — the multiplayer workspace where humans and agents think together on shared projects in real-time. Agents are participants, not tools. The CRDT shared state is stigmergic: agents coordinate through the document, not through messages. For everyone. Named after what it is.

**Meadowsyn** (bridge) — the visualization layer that connects infrastructure to experience. Donella Meadows (systems thinking) + Cybersyn (real-time operations). The connective tissue between SF and organic registers.

The layer boundary IS the brand boundary. Infrastructure speaks SF. Experience speaks garden. The inter-\* neutral register (~60 modules) coexists with both. Garden-salon language does not appear in kernel, OS, or plugin documentation — those stay in the SF register.

## Why This Exists

LLM-based agents have a fundamental problem: nothing survives. Context windows compress. Sessions end. Networks drop. Processes crash. An agent that ran for an hour, produced three artifacts, dispatched two sub-agents, and advanced through four workflow phases leaves behind... a chat transcript. The state, the decisions, the evidence, the coordination signals: gone. Not a prompting problem. An infrastructure problem. And most agent systems today handle it with temp files, environment variables, in-memory state, and hope.

Sylveste handles it with a durable kernel (SQLite-backed Go CLI), an opinionated OS that encodes development discipline, a profiler that learns from outcomes, and a constellation of companion drivers. But the infrastructure is not the aspiration.

The bet: if you build the right infrastructure beneath agents, they become capable of the full development lifecycle. Not just code generation, but discovery, design, review, testing, shipping, and compounding what was learned. And if you build a learning loop on top of that infrastructure, one that measures outcomes per dollar and feeds that signal back into model routing, agent selection, and gate calibration, you get a system where autonomy, quality, and efficiency aren't tradeoffs. They're a flywheel. More autonomy produces more outcome data. More outcome data improves routing and review. Better routing cuts cost. Lower cost enables more autonomy. The system that runs the most sprints learns the fastest.

## The Stack

Six pillars, organized in three layers plus one cross-cutting profiler. Each pillar has a clear owner, a clear boundary, and a clear survival property.

```
Layer 3: Apps (Autarch + Intercom)
├── Interactive TUI surfaces for kernel state (Autarch)
├── Bigend (monitoring), Gurgeh (PRD generation),
│   Coldwine (task orchestration), Pollard (research)
├── Multi-runtime AI assistant: Claude, Gemini, Codex (Intercom)
└── Swappable — if apps are replaced, everything beneath survives

Layer 2: OS (Clavain + Skaffen) + Drivers (Companion Plugins)
├── Clavain: opinionated workflow — phases, gates, model routing, dispatch
├── Skaffen: sovereign agent runtime — standalone Go binary, OODARC loop, multi-provider
├── Companion plugins, each wrapping one capability (`ls interverse/ | wc -l`)
├── Every driver independently installable and useful standalone
└── If the host platform changes, opinions survive; UX adapters are rewritten

Layer 1: Kernel (Intercore)
├── Host-agnostic Go CLI + SQLite WAL database
├── Runs, phases, gates, dispatches, events — the durable system of record
├── Mechanism, not policy — doesn't know what "brainstorm" means
└── If everything above disappears, the kernel and all its data survive

Cross-cutting: Profiler (Interspect)
├── Reads kernel events, correlates with human corrections
├── Proposes changes to OS configuration (routing, agent selection, gates)
├── The learning loop — the thing that makes the system improve over time
└── Today: modifies only the OS layer. The kernel boundary softens as trust is earned.
```

The survival properties are the point. Each layer can be replaced, rewritten, or removed without destroying the layers beneath it. The kernel outlives the OS. The OS outlives its host platform. The apps outlive any particular rendering choice. Practical architecture for a system that must survive the agent platform wars. Not paranoia, just planning.

### What Each Layer Does

**The kernel (Intercore)** provides mechanism. Runs, phases, gates, dispatches, events, state, locks, sentinels. A Go CLI binary: no daemon, no server, no background process. Every `ic` invocation opens the database, does its work, and exits. The SQLite database is the system of record. The kernel says "a gate can block a transition." It doesn't say "brainstorm requires an artifact." That's policy, and policy belongs in the OS.

**The OS (Clavain + Skaffen)** provides policy. Clavain is the reference agency: which phases make up a development sprint, what conditions must be met at each gate, which model to route each agent to, when to advance automatically. It orchestrates the full lifecycle from problem discovery through shipped code, opinionated about what "good" looks like at every phase, those opinions encoded in gates, review agents, and quality disciplines. Today it ships as a Claude Code plugin; the architecture is designed so the opinions survive even if the host platform doesn't. Skaffen is the sovereign agent runtime: a standalone Go binary with its own OODARC agent loop, multi-provider support, and TUI via masaq. Clavain and Skaffen are L2 peers — different runtimes sharing the same kernel.

**The profiler (Interspect)** provides learning. It reads kernel event surfaces, correlates dispatch outcomes with both human signals (review dismissals, gate overrides, manual corrections) and automated signals (CI results, revert frequency, finding density), and proposes changes to OS configuration. The signal mix shifts as autonomy increases: human-heavy at L0-L2, automated-heavy at L3-L4. Static orchestration is table stakes; a system that improves its own agents through evidence rather than intuition is what makes Sylveste different. Today, Interspect modifies only the OS layer through safe, reversible overlays. The kernel boundary is a trust threshold that softens as evidence accumulates (see PHILOSOPHY.md § Earned Authority), but the current operating level restricts Interspect to OS-level changes. Current-state caveat: the generic `ic events tail` stream is not yet the full measurement read model, and session->bead->run attribution is still being hardened. See [docs/research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md](./research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md). (Full signal taxonomy in the [Interspect vision](./interspect-vision.md).)

**The drivers (companion plugins)** provide capabilities. Multi-agent review (interflux), file coordination (interlock), ambient research (interject), token-efficient code context (tldr-swinton), agent visibility (intermux), multi-agent synthesis (intersynth), shared embedding infrastructure (intersearch), cross-session semantic caching (intercache), agent trust scoring (intertrust), knowledge compounding (interknow), and three dozen more. Each wraps one capability and integrates with kernel primitives when present. Every driver is independently installable, usable in vanilla Claude Code without Clavain, Intercore, or any other Sylveste module. Without the kernel, drivers use local or ephemeral state; with it, they get durability, coordination, and event history. The full stack provides enhanced integration, but each driver is valuable on its own.

**The apps (Autarch, Intercom)** provide surfaces. Autarch delivers interactive TUI experiences: Bigend (monitoring), Gurgeh (PRD generation), Coldwine (task orchestration), Pollard (research intelligence). Intercom provides a multi-runtime AI assistant bridging Claude, Gemini, and Codex with gate approvals and sprint notifications over messaging. The apps are a convenience layer; everything they do can be done via CLI.

## The Frontier

Sylveste advances three axes simultaneously. Every roadmap decision, every new module, every architectural choice is filtered through this lens: does it improve at least two axes without materially weakening the third?

**Autonomy.** How much of the development lifecycle runs without human intervention. Not autonomy for its own sake, but autonomy that frees the human to operate at the strategic level where their judgment matters most. Measured by sprint completion rate, gate pass rate on first attempt, intervention frequency at each autonomy level.

**Quality.** Defect escape rate, review signal precision, the ratio of actionable findings to false positives. Quality is not a phase you bolt on at the end. It's the cumulative result of discipline at every phase: brainstorm rigor, plan review depth, gate enforcement, multi-perspective code review, and the learning loop that tightens all of these over time.

**Token efficiency.** Not just raw tokens, but tokens per *impact*: cost per landable change, cost per actionable finding, cost per defect caught. The goal is not to spend less but to get more per dollar. Twelve agents should cost less than eight through orchestration optimization, *and* catch more bugs. Two tactics make this concrete: model routing as a first-class decision (no one model is best at everything: Gemini for long-context exploration, Opus for reasoning, Codex for parallel implementation, Haiku for quick checks, Oracle for cross-validation), and context hygiene via a strict write-behind protocol (raw sub-agent output persists to the kernel, but only synthesized summaries enter the orchestrator's context window, preventing the context flooding that kills long-running sprints). The current north-star baseline is still provisional rather than canonical because the landed-change denominator and attribution chain are still being standardized; see [docs/research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md](./research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md).

The flywheel connecting these three axes is Interspect. The profiler reads outcome data from every sprint and proposes configuration changes: model downgrades where Haiku catches the same issues as Opus, agent retirement where a reviewer consistently produces findings no one acts on, gate relaxation where a check always passes. Each optimization simultaneously increases autonomy (less human calibration needed), improves quality (resources reallocated to where they matter), and reduces cost (less waste). The system that ships the most sprints learns the fastest, and the system that learns the fastest ships the cheapest.

### External Validation

Two independent research threads validate the core thesis from outside software engineering:

**Orchestration beats raw capability.** Symbolica AI's Arcgentica achieved 36% on ARC-AGI-3 (abstract reasoning) at $1,005 total — while raw Claude Opus 4.6 scored 0.25% at $8,900. A 340x cost-efficiency improvement from orchestrator-delegates-to-sub-agents architecture, not from a better model. The architecture — orchestrator never touches the environment directly, sub-agents return compressed summaries, parallel hypothesis exploration — is structurally isomorphic to how Clavain dispatches companion plugins. The result validates PHILOSOPHY.md claim #1 (infrastructure bottleneck, not intelligence) on abstract reasoning, not just coding.

**Stigmergic coordination scales.** Research on agent coordination via shared environmental traces (stigmergy) shows 36-41% performance advantage over direct messaging at 500+ agents ([Pressure Fields and Temporal Decay, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08129)). Garden Salon's CRDT shared-state design — where agents coordinate through the document, not through messages — is a direct implementation of this pattern. The advantage grows with agent count, which aligns with the flywheel: more agents produce more traces, richer traces enable better coordination, better coordination justifies more agents.

These findings also reveal evaluation gaps. LLMs score 45%+ on SWE-bench but only 12.56% on NetHack (BALROG benchmark, ICLR 2025) — because NetHack demands long-horizon planning under compounding uncertainty with irreversible consequences and emergent complexity. These are exactly the capabilities Sylveste's infrastructure is designed to unlock. See [docs/research/assess-balrog-evaluation.md](./research/assess-balrog-evaluation.md) for an evaluation proposal.

## Design Principles

### 1. Mechanism over policy

The kernel provides primitives. The OS provides opinions. A phase chain is a mechanism: an ordered sequence with transition rules. The decision that software development should flow through ten phases is a policy that Clavain configures at run creation time.

That separation is what makes the system extensible without modification. A documentation project uses `draft → review → publish`. A hotfix uses `triage → fix → verify`. A research spike uses `explore → synthesize`. The kernel doesn't care. New workflows don't require new kernel code.

### 2. Durable over ephemeral

If it matters, it belongs in the database. Phase transitions, gate evidence, dispatch outcomes, event history, all persisted atomically in SQLite. Temp files, environment variables, and in-memory state are not acceptable as the long-term system of record.

Current-state caveat: this is the design rule, not a claim that every attribution path has fully reached it today. Some measurement plumbing still uses temp-file bridges and heuristic joins while the v1.5 cutover lands; see [docs/research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md](./research/interspect-event-validity-and-outcome-attribution.md).

The cost is write latency. The benefit: any session, any agent, any process can query the true state of the system at any time. When a session crashes mid-sprint, the run state is intact and resumable. When a new agent joins, it reads the same truth everyone else reads.

### 3. Compose through contracts

Small, focused tools composed through explicit interfaces beat large integrated platforms. The inter-\* constellation follows Unix philosophy: each companion does one thing well. Composition works because boundaries are explicit (typed interfaces, schemas, manifests, and declarative specs rather than prompt sorcery).

The naming convention reflects this: each companion occupies the space *between* two things. interphase (between phases), interflux (between flows), interlock (between locks), interpath (between paths). They are bridges and boundary layers, not monoliths.

### 4. Independently valuable

Any capability driver works standalone. Install interflux for multi-agent review, tldr-swinton for code context, or interlock for file coordination. No Clavain, no Intercore, no rest of the stack required. Drivers degrade gracefully: they use ephemeral state alone, durable state with the kernel. The full Sylveste stack adds adaptive improvement (profiler) and opinionated workflow (OS), but these are enhancements, not prerequisites.

The constraint also prevents consolidation creep. The temptation to fold a driver into its nearest layer (interphase into Intercore, intersynth into interflux) is always wrong if it would break standalone installation.

### 5. Human attention is the bottleneck

Agents are cheap. Human focus is scarce. The system optimizes for the human's time, not the agent's. Token efficiency is not the same as attention efficiency. Multi-agent output must be presented so humans can review quickly and confidently, not just cheaply.

The human drives strategy (what to build, which tradeoffs to accept, when to ship) while the agency drives execution (which model, which agents, what sequence, when to advance, what to review). The human is above the loop, not in it. The autonomy ladder below tracks how this plays out as intervention frequency decreases.

### 6. Gates enable velocity

Quality gates are not the opposite of speed — they are the mechanism that makes speed safe. The goal isn't more review; it's faster shipping with fewer regressions. If review phases slow you down more than they catch bugs, the gates are miscalibrated. Match rigor to risk.

Gates are kernel-enforced invariants, not prompt suggestions. An agent cannot bypass a gate regardless of what the LLM requests. This is the difference between "please check for a plan artifact" and "the system will not advance without a plan artifact." The kernel enforces gates for transitions matching its gate rules map; the OS provides additional gates (via agency specs) for OS-specific phases. Both layers contribute to enforcement; neither alone covers the full chain.

### 7. Self-building as proof

Every capability must survive contact with its own development process. Clavain builds Clavain. The agency runs its own sprints. The credibility engine: a system that autonomously builds itself is a more convincing proof than any benchmark. Also the highest-fidelity eval, because it tests the full stack under real conditions with real stakes.

## The Development Lifecycle

Sylveste covers the full product development lifecycle through five macro-stages. Each macro-stage is a sub-agency, a team of models and agents selected for the work at hand.

### Discover

Research, brainstorming, and problem definition. The agency scans sources, identifies opportunities, and frames the problem worth solving.

The discovery pipeline closes the loop between what the world knows and what the system is working on. Sources (arXiv, Hacker News, GitHub, Exa, Anthropic docs, RSS) are scored against a learned interest profile. High-confidence discoveries auto-create work items. Medium-confidence ones surface for human review. Low-confidence ones are logged for later.

The feedback loop is the interesting part: human promotions and dismissals shift the interest profile vector. Sources that consistently produce promoted discoveries earn trust. Sources that produce noise lose it. The thresholds adapt.

### Design

Strategy, specification, planning, and plan review. The agency designs the solution and validates it through multi-perspective review before any code is written.

Most agent tools fall down here: they treat product work as prompt fluff and skip straight to code. Sylveste makes brainstorm and strategy first-class phases with real artifacts, real gates, and real review. The plan review uses flux-drive with formalized cognitive lenses (security, resilience, architecture, user experience) to combat AI consensus bias.

### Build

Implementation and testing. The agency writes code, runs tests, and verifies correctness.

Codex handles parallel implementation. Opus and Sonnet handle complex reasoning. Haiku handles quick checks. Test-driven development is a discipline, not a suggestion; the TDD agents write failing tests first.

### Ship

Final review, deployment, and knowledge capture. The agency validates the change, lands it, and compounds what was learned.

The interflux fleet deploys explicit cognitive diversity lenses during final review. Oracle provides cross-AI validation. Code pushes are gated on human confirmation, where the scope of "confirmation" evolves with the autonomy ladder:
- **L0-L2 (current):** Per-change human confirmation before each push.
- **L3:** Human sets shipping policy (which repos, which confidence thresholds, which test coverage gates). Agent pushes when policy conditions are met.
- **L4:** Human approves the policy itself; agent pushes autonomously within policy bounds.

### Reflect

Capture what was learned. The agency documents patterns discovered, mistakes caught, decisions validated, and complexity calibration data. Closes the recursive learning loop: every sprint feeds knowledge back into the system.

Each macro-stage produces typed artifacts that become the next stage's input. The kernel enforces handoff via `artifact_exists` gates at macro-stage boundaries. The OS defines which artifact types satisfy each gate.

## The Autonomy Ladder

How much human intervention does a single sprint require? This ladder tracks *system capability* — what the platform can do at each level. A separate *human delegation* ladder (see PHILOSOPHY.md § Earned Authority) tracks the progressive trust relationship: how much authority the human delegates to agents, from approving every action (L0) through setting policy (L3) to agents proposing mechanism changes (L5). The two ladders are orthogonal: a system at capability Level 2 might have a human operating at delegation Level 1 or Level 2, depending on earned trust.

The human's role is fixed at every level (set objectives, make tradeoffs, approve deployments); what changes is how often they need to exercise it.

**Level 0: Record.** The kernel records what happened. Runs, phases, dispatches, artifacts, all tracked. The human drives everything. The kernel is a logbook. *(Shipped.)*

**Level 1: Enforce.** Gates evaluate real conditions. A run cannot advance without meeting preconditions. The kernel says "no" when evidence is insufficient. The human reviews every phase transition. *(Shipped.)*

**Level 2: React.** Events trigger automatic reactions. Phase transitions spawn agents. Completed dispatches advance phases. The human observes and intervenes on exceptions. *(Shipped.)*

**Level 3: Auto-remediate.** The system retries failed gates, substitutes agents, and adjusts parameters without human intervention. The human is notified of remediations but only intervenes when the system exhausts its options. *(Planned.)*

**Level 4: Auto-ship.** The system merges and deploys when confidence thresholds are met. The human approves shipping policy (which thresholds, which repos), not individual changes. *(Future.)*

No level is self-promoting. The system advances only when outcome data justifies it, and any level can be revoked if the evidence stops supporting it.

### Capability Tracks (orthogonal to autonomy)

Two capabilities cut across the autonomy ladder rather than sitting on it:

**Discovery.** The pipeline that finds work before it can be recorded. Scans sources, scores relevance, routes findings through confidence-tiered gates. Operates at any autonomy level. *(Shipped, kernel primitives landed. OS integration is the P0 frontier — wiring event-driven scan triggers and automated triage into the sprint workflow.)*

**Adaptation.** Interspect reads kernel events, correlates with outcomes, and proposes configuration changes. Agents that produce false positives get downweighted. Gate rules evolve based on evidence. Operates at any autonomy level, but its value compounds as more sprints produce more data. *(Evidence collection and routing override chain F1-F5 shipped. Next frontier: Interspect Phase 2 — evidence-driven agent selection and canary monitoring.)*

**Portfolio orchestration.** The kernel manages concurrent runs across multiple projects. Token budgets prevent runaway costs. Changes in one project trigger verification in dependents. Operates at any autonomy level. *(Shipped, portfolio primitives landed.)*

## North Star Metric

**What does it cost to ship a reviewed, tested change?**

The metric where the three frontier axes collapse into a single number. A low cost-per-landable-change requires all three: autonomy (the sprint ran without babysitting), quality (the change landed without rework), and efficiency (the right models and agents were selected, not the most expensive ones).

Supporting metrics, organized by axis:

| Axis | Metric | What It Measures |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Efficiency** | Tokens per landable change | Total token spend for a sprint that produces a merged commit |
| **Efficiency** | Agent utilization | % of dispatched agents whose output contributes to the final change |
| **Efficiency** | Model routing accuracy | % of model selections that match the outcome-optimal model |
| **Efficiency** | Time to merge | Wall-clock minutes from sprint creation to landed commit |
| **Quality** | Defect escape rate | Bugs found after Ship that were present during Build |
| **Quality** | Cost per actionable finding | Token cost of quality gate findings that aren't false positives |
| **Autonomy** | Sprint completion rate | % of sprints that reach Ship without abandonment |
| **Autonomy** | Gate pass rate | % of phase transitions that pass on first attempt |
| **Learning** | Self-improvement rate | Interspect proposals that improve metrics when applied |

The north star is economic because the platform play only works if other people can afford to run it. But cost alone is a vanity metric. A system that's cheap and wrong is worthless. The point is outcomes per dollar: defects caught per token, merge-ready changes per session, signal per gate. Interspect drives this number down over time, and the self-building loop generates the evidence Interspect needs to learn.

**Goodhart caveat:** Any stable metric becomes a target, and any target becomes gamed. Cost-per-landable-change is the north star for now, but the supporting metrics above exist to prevent tunnel vision. Rotate emphasis, diversify evaluation dimensions, and watch for agents optimizing the metric at the expense of actual quality. (See PHILOSOPHY.md § Receipts Close Loops, Measurement.)

The cost-per-landable-change baseline was established on 2026-02-28 (iv-b46xi, closed). The baseline ($1.17/landable change, Opus 95% of cost) provides the denominator for Interspect's adaptive routing flywheel.

## Audience

Two brands serve two audiences through shared infrastructure:

**Sylveste** (infrastructure) — for developers and platform builders who want to build autonomous agencies. Intercore is the kernel. Clavain is the reference agency. Open source from launch.

**Garden Salon** (experience) — for anyone who wants to think with AI agents on shared projects. Agents are participants in the workspace, not tools invoked from a sidebar. The CRDT substrate means agents coordinate through the document itself.

Three concentric circles, in priority order:

1. **Platform.** Open Intercore as infrastructure for anyone building autonomous agencies. Open Clavain as the reference agency. The whole stack, open source, from launch. Software development is the first vertical; the primitives are domain-general.

2. **Proof by demonstration.** Build the system with the system. Every capability must survive contact with its own development process. A system that autonomously builds itself is a more convincing proof than any benchmark. The autonomous epic execution track (rsj.1) is the latest proof: the system sequences its own multi-feature work.

3. **Personal rig.** One product-minded engineer, as effective as a full team. The personal rig is both the daily driver and the proving ground for the platform. Optimized relentlessly for one workflow, but the architecture ensures those optimizations generalize.

## Open Source Strategy

Everything is open source. All six pillars: the kernel (Intercore), the OS (Clavain), the sovereign runtime (Skaffen), the companion plugins (Interverse), the TUI tools (Autarch), and the profiler (Interspect).

The bet is on ecosystem effects. If the kernel is good enough, people will build their own agencies on top of it. If the reference agency is good enough, people will write their own companions. The value of the platform increases with every external contribution, and the learning loop (Interspect) benefits from a larger evidence base.

Revenue, when it matters, comes from managed hosting, enterprise support, and premium companions. Not from restricting access to the core infrastructure.

## Where We Are

As of late March 2026:

- **Kernel:** 8 of 10 epics shipped (E1-E8). Runs, phases, gates, dispatches, events, discovery pipeline, rollback, portfolio orchestration, TOCTOU prevention, cost-aware scheduling, fair spawn scheduler, sandbox specs, durable session attribution (v31). All landed and tested. Remaining: E9 (Autarch Phase 2 — Pollard + Gurgeh migration) and E10 (Sandboxing + Autarch Phase 3).
- **OS:** Full sprint lifecycle (brainstorm → ship) is kernel-driven. Sprint consolidation complete (`/route → /sprint → /work` unified into adaptive single-entry workflow). For current stats: `grep -c '^##' os/Clavain/skills/*/SKILL.md` (skills), `ls os/Clavain/agents/` (agents).
- **Autonomous epic execution (rsj.1):** `/campaign` command orchestrates epic-level build sequences — topological sort of children by dependency graph, phase-gated dispatch through `/route`, resume-aware checkpointing. Supporting infrastructure: strategic contradiction escalation (lane pause on intent misalignment), outcome-based epic DoD (measurable acceptance criteria beyond "all children closed"), provenance vectors (stemma-based backward tracing of artifact lineage), decomposition quality calibration (historical baseline from 98 epics, auto-calibration at N=30 fresh events), and temple invariant checker (continuous syntax/secret/structural checks during sprint execution). 10 of 12 P0+P1 beads shipped; 2 blocked on external preconditions.
- **Model routing:** Static routing, complexity-aware routing (C1-C5), and routing override chain (F1-F5) shipped. Adaptive routing (B3) is the next frontier — evidence pipeline and canary monitoring.
- **Agency architecture:** Track C fully shipped (C1-C5). Agency specs, fleet registry, composer, cross-phase handoff, and self-building loop all landed and tested.
- **Review engine:** 12 specialized review agents + 37 generated review agents, deployed through interflux with multi-agent synthesis. Capability declarations shipped. Interoperability benchmark harness completed.
- **Ecosystem:** Companion plugins shipped, each independently installable (`ls interverse/ | wc -l`). Total modules: `find apps os core interverse sdk -maxdepth 2 -name .git -printf '%h\n' 2>/dev/null | wc -l`.
- **Apps:** Autarch TUI (Bigend monitoring with inline mode, Gurgeh PRD generation, Coldwine task orchestration, Pollard research). Intercom multi-runtime AI assistant bridging Claude, Gemini, and Codex (v1.1.0).
- **Profiler:** Evidence collection and routing override chain (F1-F5) shipped. Adaptive routing flywheel activated. Evidence quarantine (48h delay before influencing routing) shipped.
- **Two-brand architecture:** Sylveste (infrastructure) and Garden Salon (experience) established as distinct brands with shared kernel. Meadowsyn (visualization bridge) domain registered.
- **Self-building:** The system has been building itself for months. Run `bd stats` for current counts.

## What's Next

Four tracks converged: kernel integration (A), model routing (B1-B2), agency architecture (C1-C5), and autonomous epic execution (D1-D10) are all shipped. The frontier has shifted to five themes:

1. **Garden Salon MVP** (P0) — Multiplayer workspace with CRDT shared state, stigmergic agent participation. The experience brand. See garden-salon brainstorm for architecture.
2. **Intercom cutover** (P0) — Rust/Postgres control-plane migration replacing Node/SQLite.
3. **Adaptive routing** (P1) — Interspect evidence-driven agent selection, canary monitoring, counterfactual shadow evaluation. The flywheel thesis. Interspect Phase 2.
4. **Domain-general north star** (P1) — "Cost per landable change" is software-dev-specific. The platform needs a domain-general metric. Candidates: cost per verified outcome, superadditive capability score (SCS), diversity-weighted signal quality.
5. **Interflux reaction round** (P2) — Adding one reaction round to multi-agent review unlocks 5 of 7 SOTA techniques (DMAD, Free-MAD, CONSENSAGENT, Lorenzen dialogue, QDAIF). Single highest-leverage architectural change for review quality.

B3 (adaptive routing via Interspect outcome data) is the primary strategic frontier. D-track autonomous epic execution proved the flywheel at the epic level — agents now self-sequence multi-feature work with phase gates, strategic contradiction detection, and decomposition calibration.

## What This Is Not

- **Not a general AI gateway.** It doesn't route arbitrary messages to arbitrary agents. The platform orchestrates complex knowledge work through discipline and evidence. Software development is the first vertical; Garden Salon opens the second (collaborative thinking). The platform primitives (Gridfire: Flows, Actions, Receipts, Gates, Controllers, Capabilities, RunGraphs) are domain-general by design.
- **Not a coding assistant.** It doesn't help you write code; it *builds software*. The coding is one phase of five.
- **Not a no-code tool.** It's for people who build software with agents. Full stop.
- **Not uncontrollably self-modifying.** Interspect modifies OS-level configuration through safe, reversible overlays. It cannot modify the kernel today — but the kernel boundary is a trust threshold, not a permanent architectural invariant. It softens as trust is earned, through gated evidence-based processes, not direct modification. (See PHILOSOPHY.md § Earned Authority.)
- **Not just an agency.** Sylveste is the platform; Clavain is the reference agency built on it. The kernel and drivers are infrastructure anyone can use to build their own agency.

## Origins

Sylveste (from Alastair Reynolds' Democratic Anarchists, reflecting the continuous polling and consensus-driven architecture of the system). Clavain is a protagonist from the same series. The inter-\* naming convention describes what each component does: the space *between* things. Interverse is the universe that contains them all.

The project began by merging [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [superpowers-lab](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab), [superpowers-developing-for-claude-code](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-developing-for-claude-code), and [compound-engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin). It has since grown into an autonomous software development agency platform with five pillars. Current module count: `find apps os core interverse sdk -maxdepth 2 -name .git -printf '%h\n' 2>/dev/null | wc -l`.
