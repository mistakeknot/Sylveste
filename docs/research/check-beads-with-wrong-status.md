## Category 1: Beads That Should Be CLOSED (currently OPEN)

These beads have `feat:`, `fix:`, or `refactor:` commits proving the work is done. All are recovered placeholders at P4 with OPEN status.

### High confidence (feat/fix commits with clear completion signal)

### Medium confidence (feature commits from subproject repos, work appears complete)

| Bead ID | Current Status | Commit Evidence | Recommended Action |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **iv-7g4ao** | P4 OPEN | `ec659ff` (intermute) "feat(intermute): add coordination dual-write bridge to intercore.db" | `bd close iv-7g4ao --reason "feature landed in intermute ec659ff"` |

**Total beads that should be closed: 28** (15 high confidence + 13 medium confidence)

## Category 2: Beads Correctly OPEN (docs/planning only, no code delivery)

These beads have only `docs:` commits (brainstorms, PRDs, plans) and should remain open because the feature hasn't been implemented yet.

| Bead ID | Current Status | Reasoning |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| iv-be0ik.1 | P4 OPEN | docs: CI baseline plan -- planning only |
| iv-be0ik.2 | P4 OPEN | docs: CI test coverage matrix -- planning docs in Sylveste root, BUT also has `ci:` commit `9adf8d4` in interphase and `d1e350f` in interflux. **Ambiguous** -- see note below. |
| iv-eblwb | P4 OPEN | docs: Autarch UX review -- review artifacts only |
| iv-gyq9l | P4 OPEN | docs: brainstorm and plan for intent submission |
| iv-jay06 | P4 OPEN | docs: interbase multi-language SDK brainstorm/PRD/plan |
| iv-wnurj | P4 OPEN | docs: ToolError guide update and sprint plan |
| iv-ynbh | P3 OPEN | Pre-existing bead, only brainstorm/plan docs committed. Correctly open. |
| iv-446o7.2 | P4 OPEN | Has `ci:` commits adding Dependabot config across 4 repos. **Should actually be CLOSED** -- see note below. |

### Notes on ambiguous cases

**iv-be0ik.2**: Has `docs:` commit in Sylveste root but also a `ci: add test-running CI workflow (iv-be0ik.2)` commit in interphase (`9adf8d4`) and interflux (`d1e350f`). The CI workflow was actually implemented. **Recommend closing**: `bd close iv-be0ik.2 --reason "CI workflow implemented in interphase 9adf8d4 and interflux d1e350f"`

**iv-446o7.2**: Has `ci: add Dependabot config for automated dependency updates (iv-446o7.2)` commits in intercore (`c6fc4cf`), intermute (`c9427c3`), clavain (`c0d2073`), autarch (`374f6b0`). This work is clearly done. **Recommend closing**: `bd close iv-446o7.2 --reason "Dependabot config deployed to all 4 repos"`

## Category 3: Beads with IN_PROGRESS Status (intercom IronClaw children)

These 11 recovered beads are children of `iv-yfkln` (IronClaw migration epic) and were set to IN_PROGRESS during recovery. All have `feat:` commits in the intercom repo showing completed work.

| Bead ID | Status | Commit Evidence | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| iv-tgw66 | IN_PROGRESS | `c566edc` feat: add Rust migration foundation | Close -- migration foundation landed |
| iv-unhm6 | IN_PROGRESS | `f1bbfa9` feat: implement registered-groups state | Close -- state impl landed |
| iv-oiait | IN_PROGRESS | `2b235db` feat: add systemd unit for intercomd | Close -- systemd unit landed |
| iv-jsvpc | IN_PROGRESS | `a79029e` feat: add Postgres persistence layer | Close -- persistence layer landed |
| iv-g2akk | IN_PROGRESS | `a79029e` same commit as iv-jsvpc (duplicate) | Close as duplicate of iv-jsvpc |
| iv-xknuw | P4 OPEN | `32ad1ad` feat: add event consumer loop | Close -- event loop landed |
| iv-2w8db | IN_PROGRESS | `4f76f59` feat: add shared orchestrator state | Close -- orchestrator state landed |
| iv-al5yn | IN_PROGRESS | `d96118e` docs: add Phase 4 orchestrator wiring plan | Keep IN_PROGRESS or close -- this is a docs/plan commit, but within the IronClaw context it represents completed planning work |
| iv-de99u | IN_PROGRESS | `d8f83da` Add Telegram ingress/egress bridge | Close -- Telegram bridge landed |
| iv-xwzgm | IN_PROGRESS | `f5ee38b` Add idempotent SQLite to Postgres migration | Close -- migration tool landed |
| iv-i3oxs | IN_PROGRESS | `9b1ee01` fix: wire write_snapshots + `047f0f2` refactor: remove dead Node code | Close -- fix + cleanup both landed |
| iv-u0gmm | IN_PROGRESS | `5135f7b` feat: IronClaw Phase 5 + `b4bbbc3` fix: quality-gate findings | Close -- Phase 5 delivered and polished |

**Total: 11 beads should be closed** (10 with high confidence, 1 ambiguous docs-only)

---

## Category 4: Correctly CLOSED Beads

| Bead ID | Status | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| iv-brcmt | P4 CLOSED | Correctly closed as duplicate of iv-1xtgd |
| iv-9hx1t | P1 CLOSED | Correctly closed as duplicate of iv-be0ik |
| iv-xftvq | P1 CLOSED | Correctly closed as duplicate of iv-be0ik |
| iv-ip4zr | P1 CLOSED | Correctly closed as duplicate of iv-be0ik |
| iv-kpoz8 | P1 CLOSED | Correctly closed as duplicate of iv-be0ik |

No incorrectly closed beads were found.

## Category 5: Dependency Integrity Issues

### Issue 1: iv-ynbh blocking iv-qjwz (NOT a problem)

`iv-ynbh` (Agent trust and reputation scoring) blocks `iv-qjwz` (AgentDropout). This is **correctly configured** -- iv-ynbh is a pre-existing P3 feature bead (created 2026-02-15) that only received brainstorm/plan docs in this period. The feature is not implemented, so the dependency is valid.

### Issue 2: No recovered beads are incorrectly blocking other work

Cross-referencing the 48 blocked beads against recovered bead IDs: none of the recovered beads appear as blockers. All blockers in `bd blocked` output are pre-existing non-recovered beads (`iv-w7bh`, `iv-asfy`, `iv-f7po`, `iv-r6mf`, `iv-ho3`, `iv-6376`, etc.).

### Issue 3: iv-1xtgd.1 still OPEN at P2

`iv-1xtgd.1` ("refactor: centralize plugin cache discovery") is a child of iv-1xtgd (which should be closed). It has a `refactor:` commit (`6e81908` in clavain). Since the parent epic was explicitly closed in commit `f58b378`, this subtask should also be closed.

**Recommend**: `bd close iv-1xtgd.1 --reason "parent epic iv-1xtgd closed in f58b378, refactor landed in clavain 6e81908"`

## Beads NOT Flagged (correctly open, no action needed)

These beads are correctly in OPEN or IN_PROGRESS status:

- **iv-ynbh** (P3 OPEN) -- pre-existing, only planning docs, blocks iv-qjwz correctly
- **iv-eblwb** (P4 OPEN) -- UX review docs only, no implementation
- **iv-gyq9l** (P4 OPEN) -- brainstorm and plan only
- **iv-jay06** (P4 OPEN) -- brainstorm, PRD, and plan only
- **iv-wnurj** (P4 OPEN) -- docs update and sprint plan only
- **iv-be0ik** (P1 OPEN) -- roadmap recovery placeholder, status unknown
- **iv-be0ik.1** (P4 OPEN) -- CI baseline plan docs only
- **iv-v9ksd** (P4 OPEN) -- no matching commit found in analyzed period
- **iv-yfkln** (P1 IN_PROGRESS) -- parent epic, children still need closing first
- **iv-yfkln.1 through iv-yfkln.5** (IN_PROGRESS) -- non-recovered children of active epic
