# Synthesis: Quality-Gates Review — flux-gen v4 Agent Generation Refactor

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** 7 files changed across Python and Markdown. Risk domains: file I/O (atomic writes), regex markdown parsing, cache format migration. No auth/crypto/concurrent code.

**Agents:** 3 launched, 3 completed, 0 failed
**Overall Verdict:** `needs-changes` (consensus across all reviewers)

---

## Validation Report

| Agent | Status | Verdict | Summary |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| fd-architecture | Valid | safe | Architecture is sound; issues are corrective, not blocking. Cache versioning and documentation gaps identified. |
| fd-correctness | Valid | needs-changes | File I/O core is sound; frontmatter parsing is fragile; schema mismatch requires immediate fix. |
| fd-quality | Valid | needs-changes | Clean template engine; three P2 issues (fd leak, schema, cache parse) must be addressed before production. |

## Critical Findings (Must Fix Before Merge)

### P2 Issues: 3 Total

#### 1. **File Descriptor Leak in `_atomic_write` (QS-01 / F2)**
- **Severity:** P2 (MEDIUM)
- **Agents:** fd-correctness (F2), fd-quality (QS-01) — **CONVERGENCE: 2/3**
- **Location:** `/home/mk/projects/Sylveste/interverse/interflux/scripts/generate-agents.py:369–384`
- **Issue:** Double-close on rename failure path after successful `os.close(fd)`. Exception handler calls `os.close(fd)` again, relying on OSError catch to swallow EBADF. More critically, `KeyboardInterrupt` after `os.close` but before `os.rename` bypasses cleanup entirely, leaving `.tmp` orphan files in `agents_dir`.
- **Impact:** Temp files can accumulate on disk; silent failure mode makes production incident diagnosis harder. Not an immediate file corruption risk (unlink runs inside except), but violates POSIX cleanup discipline.
- **Recommended Fix:** Restructure with two separate try blocks: (1) write+fsync+close in finally block, (2) rename with separate exception handler for unlink. This pattern already used correctly in `detect-domains.py:write_cache`.
- **Code Pattern:**
  ```python
  fd, tmp_path_str = tempfile.mkstemp(dir=str(path.parent), suffix=".tmp")
  try:
      os.write(fd, data)
      os.fsync(fd)
  finally:
      os.close(fd)
  try:
      os.rename(tmp_path_str, str(path))
  except Exception:
      try:
          os.unlink(tmp_path_str)
      except OSError:
          pass
      raise
  ```

#### 2. **Report Schema Mismatch: `generate()` vs SKILL.md Contract (QS-02 / implicit in F7)**
- **Severity:** P2 (MEDIUM)
- **Agents:** fd-correctness (F7), fd-quality (QS-02) — **CONVERGENCE: 2/3**
- **Location:**
  - Script return: `generate-agents.py:469–491` returns `{"status": "ok", "generated": [...], "skipped": [...], "orphaned": [...], "errors": [...]}`
  - SKILL.md contract: `skills/flux-drive/SKILL.md:771–782` documents `{"status": "ok", "agents": [{"name": ..., "action": "created"|"skipped"|...}]}`
- **Issue:** Structurally incompatible schemas. The LLM orchestrator in SKILL.md Step 1.0.4 is told to parse `agents[].action` but receives four separate lists (`generated`, `skipped`, `orphaned`, `errors`). LLM code following the documented contract will fail silently (KeyError or empty iteration).
- **Impact:** LLM-driven agents parsing the report will misinterpret results, leading to incorrect downstream decisions (e.g., skipped agents treated as orphaned, no distinction between generation error and no domains).
- **Recommended Fix:** Update SKILL.md Step 1.0.4 to document the **actual** four-list schema. Do NOT change the script — the flat four-list structure is simpler to generate and parse in LLM context. `flux-gen.md` Step 2 already uses the correct schema.
- **Why Not Unified List:** While I-02 improvement suggests unifying to `agents[{"name": ..., "action": "created"|"skipped"|"orphaned"`, "reason": ...}]`, the current four-list schema is correct for the use case (simpler JSON emission, no per-item reason field needed). The bug is purely in documentation.

#### 3. **Cache Parse Exception Loses Error Signal (QS-03)**
- **Severity:** P2 (MEDIUM)
- **Agents:** fd-quality (QS-03) — **CONVERGENCE: 1/3** (minor; not repeated by others but self-contained)
- **Location:** `scripts/generate-agents.py:427–432`
- **Issue:** When cache YAML is corrupt (partial write from crash), `yaml.safe_load` raises an exception caught as `Exception as exc`. The function sets `status: no_domains` and appends to `errors[]`, then returns. In non-`--json` mode, the error message is **never printed** — only `status: no_domains` reaches stderr. To a human observer, the cache failure is silent and appears as "no domains found" rather than "cache corrupted."
- **Impact:** Production incident: corrupt cache is silently treated as empty domain list. Troubleshooting is harder because the error signal is lost. SKILL.md Step 1.0.1 will proceed to Step 1.1 with core agents only, masking the underlying cache corruption.
- **Recommended Fix:** Either (a) print `errors[]` to stderr before early return, or (b) return exit code 2 for parse failures (SKILL.md can map exit 2 to "log warning" vs exit 1 for "no domains"). Prefer (a) for consistency with CLI output patterns.

## Important Findings (Should Fix)

### P1 Issues: 0 (none identified)

### P2 Issues (Continued from above): 3

### P3 Issues: 5 Total

#### 4. **Frontmatter Parser Accepts `---` Inside YAML Values (F1 / implicit)**
- **Severity:** P2/P3 boundary (MEDIUM, not in critical path)
- **Agents:** fd-correctness (F1) — **CONVERGENCE: 1/3** (correctness expert focus)
- **Location:** `scripts/generate-agents.py:350`
- **Issue:** `_parse_frontmatter` uses `str.find("---", 3)` which matches the three-character sequence anywhere in the file, not anchored to line start. A YAML value containing `---` (e.g., an em-dash sequence in a persona field) causes the parser to find a false closing fence, truncate the YAML block, and return None. In skip-existing mode, this silently overwrites a user-customized agent file.
- **Impact:** Silent data loss. If a user manually customizes an agent file with a persona containing `---`, re-running generation overwrites it without warning.
- **Recommended Fix:** Replace with line-anchored regex: `re.search(r"(?m)^---$", text[3:])`. Add a test case with `---` in a YAML string.
- **Introduced Test Case:**
  ```python
  text = "---\npersona: example---em-dash\nfocus: core\n---\n# Agent"
  result = _parse_frontmatter(text)
  assert result is not None, "False positive on --- inside YAML value"
  ```

#### 5. **Cache Format Version Mismatch: v1 → v2 Unchecked (A1)**
- **Severity:** P2 (MEDIUM, architectural debt)
- **Agents:** fd-architecture (A1) — **CONVERGENCE: 1/3** (architecture expert focus)
- **Location:** `detect-domains.py:50` (writes v1), `SKILL.md:672` (LLM writes v2), `generate-agents.py:428` (reader accepts both unchecked)
- **Issue:** The heuristic path still writes `cache_version: 1`, but SKILL.md directs the LLM path to write `cache_version: 2`. The reader in `generate-agents.py` has no version check; it blindly accepts whatever dict YAML loads. Staleness detection keys off `content_hash` presence (missing = stale), so both versions are handled, but the version ambiguity will accumulate as the schema evolves.
- **Impact:** Future schema changes (e.g., adding a `domains_list` field) will have unclear backward-compat semantics. Current dual-write situation is unintended and fragile.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `CACHE_VERSION = 2` constant to both `generate-agents.py` and `detect-domains.py`. LLM path writes v2. Reader validates version on load and raises an error if v1 is encountered (v1 is now deprecated in favor of LLM-driven detection).

#### 6. **Content Hash Computation Delegated to LLM Prose (A2)**
- **Severity:** P2 (MEDIUM, non-deterministic)
- **Agents:** fd-architecture (A2) — **CONVERGENCE: 1/3** (architecture expert focus)
- **Location:** `SKILL.md:Step 1.0.1–1.0.2` (natural language hash spec)
- **Issue:** SKILL.md instructs the LLM to compute `content_hash` by hashing README + build file + 2-3 key source files (prose spec). There is no Python function or script that owns this contract, making it non-deterministic across LLM runs (different file selection, encoding, normalization). This is an inversion of the `detect-domains.py` pattern (before removal) which had a deterministic `compute_structural_hash()` function. The field is load-bearing: SKILL.md uses it to skip re-detection, so if hash computation drifts between write and read, every invocation re-detects.
- **Impact:** Cache staleness checking is only pseudo-deterministic. Spec drift can cause re-detection on every run, negating cache benefits.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `compute_content_hash(project: Path, files: list[Path]) -> str` function to `generate-agents.py`. Have SKILL.md call `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate-agents.py {PROJECT_ROOT} --content-hash` to compute the hash for both cache write and staleness checks. Ensures determinism.

#### 7. **Off-by-One Loop Guard Confusing but Not Buggy (QS-04)**
- **Severity:** P3 (LOW, readability)
- **Agents:** fd-quality (QS-04) — **CONVERGENCE: 1/3**
- **Location:** `scripts/generate-agents.py:107`
- **Issue:** Loop guard `while i < len(agent_blocks) - 1:` reads as "stop one before the last" but is actually correct (guards pair access). No actual bug, but confusing phrasing could cause future maintainer to "fix" it to `< len(agent_blocks)`, which would raise IndexError.
- **Impact:** Potential future regression if guard is misunderstood.
- **Recommended Fix:** Clarify to `while i + 1 < len(agent_blocks):` making pair-access invariant obvious.

#### 8. **Timestamp Not Deterministic (QS-05 / F6 / A3-implicit)**
- **Severity:** P3 (LOW, contradicts documentation but not a logic bug)
- **Agents:** fd-quality (QS-05), fd-correctness (F6) — **CONVERGENCE: 2/3**
- **Location:** `scripts/generate-agents.py:231`
- **Issue:** `generated_at` field is stamped with `datetime.now(utc)` on every call, breaking the claim in `flux-gen.md:221` that "Generation is deterministic — same domain profile always produces the same agent file." Idempotency checks fail; `--dry-run` reporting differs from actual generation.
- **Impact:** False confidence for idempotency. Confuses developers attempting up-to-date detection.
- **Recommended Fix:** Either (a) omit `generated_at` from output, or (b) qualify the documentation: "deterministic except for the `generated_at` timestamp, which is informational only." The `flux_gen_version` field is sufficient for staleness; `generated_at` is metadata.

#### 9. **CLI Integration Test Not Isolated (QS-06)**
- **Severity:** P3 (LOW, test hygiene)
- **Agents:** fd-quality (QS-06), fd-architecture (A5) — **CONVERGENCE: 2/3**
- **Location:** `tests/structural/test_generate_agents.py:491–504`
- **Issue:** `TestCLIIntegration.test_cli_json_output()` cannot monkeypatch `DOMAINS_DIR` for subprocess, so falls back to reading live `/home/mk/projects/Sylveste/interverse/interflux/config/flux-drive/domains/game-simulation.md`. Test is sensitive to real profile structure; if profile is renamed or restructured, test fails with unintuitive assertion error. Test is effectively an integration test dressed as unit test.
- **Impact:** Brittle test; false negatives when domain profiles change.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `--domains-dir` CLI override to `generate-agents.py` for test purposes. Let subprocess tests pass a mock domains dir. Alternatively, rename class to `TestCLIIntegrationRealProfiles` and add `@pytest.mark.integration` marker.

#### 10. **AGENTS.md Stale: `generate-agents.py` Not Listed (A3 / QS-08)**
- **Severity:** P3 (LOW, documentation debt)
- **Agents:** fd-architecture (A3), fd-quality (QS-08) — **CONVERGENCE: 2/3**
- **Location:** `interflux/AGENTS.md:103–105` (scripts/ listing)
- **Issue:** `generate-agents.py` is not listed in the architecture tree. AGENTS.md is the canonical quick-reference for contributors. Omission causes confusion during onboarding or incident response.
- **Impact:** Contributor friction; incomplete architecture understanding.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `generate-agents.py` to scripts/ listing with description "Template expansion and orphan detection."

## Verdict Summary

### Gate Determination

- **P0 Blockers:** 0
- **P1 Blockers:** 0
- **P2 Must-Fix:** 6 issues (3 critical paths, 3 architectural)
  - FD leak (affects reliability)
  - Schema mismatch (affects LLM orchestration)
  - Cache parse error signal (affects debuggability)
  - Frontmatter parser fragility (affects data integrity)
  - Cache version ambiguity (affects evolution)
  - Content hash determinism (affects cache efficacy)
- **P3 Should-Fix:** 5 issues + 3 improvements (polish, UX, documentation)

### Recommendations

**DO NOT MERGE** until the three P2 issues in the critical path are addressed:
1. Fix `_atomic_write` cleanup structure
2. Update SKILL.md Step 1.0.4 to document actual schema
3. Add error printing to cache parse exception handler

After these three fixes, the following P2 issues can be resolved in follow-up commits:
- Add cache version constant and v1 deprecation notice
- Implement deterministic `content_hash` function
- Fix frontmatter parser regex to line-anchor

The P3 issues can be fixed immediately or deferred to next sprint without blocking merge, once P2 critical path is clear.

### Overall Status

**Verdict: `needs-changes`** — Consensus from all three reviewers. The architecture is sound and the refactor is well-motivated, but file I/O discipline and schema documentation gaps must be resolved before production use.
