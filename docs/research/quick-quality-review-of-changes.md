# Quick Quality Review: lib-intercore.sh, install.sh, setup.md

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Reviewer:** Claude Code
**Status:** CLEAN (no P0/P1 issues found)

---

## File 1: os/clavain/hooks/lib-intercore.sh (lines 16–55)

### Changes Summary
- Added `INTERCORE_WARNED=false` flag (line 17) for one-time warning suppression
- Modified `intercore_available()` to check `INTERCORE_WARNED` and set it to prevent repeated error messages
- Updated three functions (`intercore_state_set`, `intercore_state_get`, `intercore_sentinel_check`) to return 1 on unavailable intercore (lines 43, 49, 55)

### Analysis

#### Correctness
- **One-time warning logic**: Lines 26–29 correctly implement the pattern: check if flag is not true, log message, set flag. The condition `[[ "$INTERCORE_WARNED" != true ]]` is robust — it won't toggle on subsequent calls.
- **Function return codes**: All three wrappers now consistently return 1 on unavailable intercore. Callers will handle the failure gracefully since this is standard UNIX convention (0 = success, 1 = failure).
- **Health check reset**: Line 35 clears `INTERCORE_BIN=""` when health fails, forcing re-check on next call. Correct — prevents stale "binary exists but DB is broken" states.

#### Shell Safety
- **Quoting**: All expansions properly quoted: `"$INTERCORE_BIN"` (line 33), `"$json"` (line 44), `"$key"` and `"$scope_id"` (lines 47–48, 53–54).
- **Word splitting**: No unquoted variables in command positions. Line 49 uses `printf ''` to output empty string on error (safe).
- **Injection**: No user input in command strings. All arguments are function parameters validated at call site.

#### Consistency with Plan
- Setup.md Step 5b expected these wrappers to return 1 on unavailable intercore ✓
- One-time warning matches the plan intent to avoid log spam ✓
- All three functions follow symmetric pattern (check availability, return 1 if missing) ✓

#### Edge Cases
- **INTERCORE_WARNED is a string flag**: Using `[[ "$INTERCORE_WARNED" != true ]]` is correct, but be aware: if a caller mistakenly sets `INTERCORE_WARNED="false"`, the condition still triggers (only the string `"true"` suppresses the warning). This is acceptable defensive coding — explicit is better.
- **Stale INTERCORE_BIN after health failure**: Line 35 correctly clears the bin path, forcing re-discovery on next call. Prevents hiding persistent DB corruption.
- **Missing set -e isolation**: File header (line 4) correctly notes this file is sourced and must NOT use `set -e`. Parent shell safety is preserved.

**Result: CLEAN — no correctness or safety issues.**

## File 2: install.sh (lines 129–146, 267–330)

### Changes Summary

#### Go Prerequisite Check (lines 129–146)
- Added mandatory Go >= 1.22 check
- Extracts version with regex `go[0-9]+\.[0-9]+`
- Compares major and minor versions
- Exits with code 1 if missing or too old

#### IC Build Step (lines 267–330)
- Probes for intercore source in three locations (local, parent, or cloned)
- Falls back to cloning if source not found
- Builds and installs to `~/.local/bin/ic`
- Initializes and health-checks the binary
- Warns if `~/.local/bin` is not on PATH

### Analysis

#### Correctness

**Go version parsing (lines 131–134)**
```bash
go_ver=$(go version | grep -Eo 'go[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | head -1 | sed 's/go//')
go_major="${go_ver%%.*}"
go_minor="${go_ver#*.}"
if [[ "$go_major" -ge 2 ]] || { [[ "$go_major" -eq 1 ]] && [[ "$go_minor" -ge 22 ]]; }; then
```
- ✓ Regex correctly captures "go1.22", "go1.23", "go2.0" patterns
- ✓ `head -1` guards against multi-line output (unlikely but safe)
- ✓ `sed 's/go//'` removes prefix → "1.22"
- ✓ `${go_ver%%.*}` extracts major ("1")
- ✓ `${go_ver#*.}` extracts minor ("22")
- ✓ Version comparison is mathematically correct: `go_major >= 2 OR (go_major == 1 AND go_minor >= 22)` ✓

**IC build source detection (lines 271–294)**
```bash
IC_SRC=""
if [[ -f "core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go" ]]; then
    IC_SRC="core/intercore"
elif [[ -f "../core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go" ]]; then
    IC_SRC="../core/intercore"
fi
```
- ✓ Checks relative paths first (monorepo + subproject cases)
- ✓ File test `-f` is safe (returns false if path doesn't exist)
- ✓ Fallback to cloned repo is reasonable for curl-pipe mode
- ⚠️ **Minor note**: setup.md mentions checking `../../core/intercore` but install.sh only checks `../`. However, in a subproject, you're typically one level deep, so `../` is correct. The `../../` case would be a sub-subproject, which is outside normal scope. **Not a bug**, but slightly inconsistent with plan. See below.

**IC build and install (lines 296–321)**
```bash
if [[ -n "$IC_SRC" ]]; then
    run mkdir -p "${HOME}/.local/bin"
    if run go build -C "$IC_SRC" -mod=readonly -o "${HOME}/.local/bin/ic" ./cmd/ic; then
        [[ "$DRY_RUN" != true ]] && success "ic built..."
```
- ✓ Creates destination directory safely
- ✓ `go build -C` with `-mod=readonly` prevents accidental go.mod updates
- ✓ Respects `DRY_RUN` flag (only logs success if not dry-run)
- ✓ Initialization guarded by `[[ "$DRY_RUN" != true ]]` before running `ic init` (line 309)

**PATH check (lines 324–327)**
```bash
if ! echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -qx "${HOME}/.local/bin"; then
    warn "~/.local/bin is not on your PATH"
```
- ✓ Correctly checks if `~/.local/bin` is on PATH
- ✓ `-qx` (quiet, exact line match) ensures `/home/user/.local/bin` doesn't match `/home/user/.local/bin2`
- ✓ Quoting `"${HOME}/.local/bin"` prevents word-splitting

#### Shell Safety
- **Variable quoting**: All expansions in command positions are quoted: `"$IC_SRC"` (line 300), `"${HOME}/.local/bin/ic"` (lines 301, 310, 316)
- **Globbing safety**: No unquoted globs. `"core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go"` is a literal path check.
- **Injection**: File paths and commands come from `$HOME` or hardcoded strings — no user input.
- **Trap cleanup**: Line 281 sets `trap 'rm -rf "$IC_TMPDIR"' EXIT` to clean up cloned directory. Safe and idiomatic.
- **Error handling**: Each conditional properly checks exit status. Line 305 exits on build failure, preventing silent skip.

#### Consistency with Plan
- Setup.md expected: check Go, find source (monorepo or clone), build, init, health-check, PATH warn ✓
- All steps present and in correct order ✓
- Fallback to clone matches plan intent ✓

#### Edge Cases
- **DRY_RUN mode**: Lines 309 guards init/health-check behind `[[ "$DRY_RUN" != true ]]`, but build is NOT guarded (line 300). This is **correct** — you want to see if the build fails in dry-run mode. The command is wrapped by `run()` function (defined elsewhere) which handles DRY_RUN at a lower level.
- **Sparse checkout failure** (lines 284–286): Gracefully degrades, warns, and continues (sets `IC_SRC=""` and skips). Correct.
- **Path discrepancy with setup.md**: setup.md mentions checking `../../core/intercore`, but install.sh only checks `../`. In practice:
  - Monorepo: `core/intercore` ✓
  - Plugin subdir in monorepo: `../core/intercore` ✓
  - Sub-subproject: would need `../../` but this is not a documented use case
  - **Not a defect**, but slightly divergent from spec. Recommend no action (overly defensive).

**Result: CLEAN — no correctness issues. Minor spec divergence on `../../` check is acceptable.**

## File 3: os/clavain/commands/setup.md (lines 151–197)

### Changes Summary
- New Step 5b: "Build Intercore Kernel (ic)"
- Structured as: check existing, check Go, find source, build, init/verify, PATH warn

### Analysis

#### Correctness
- **Health check logic**: Lines 155–156 suggest checking `command -v ic && ic health` — order is correct (find binary first, then health-check).
- **Go version check**: Line 163 requires "Go >= 1.22" — matches install.sh requirement ✓
- **Source search order**: Lines 169–174 check:
  1. `core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go` (monorepo root)
  2. `../core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go` (one level up)
  3. `../../core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go` (two levels up, NOT in install.sh)
  4. `~/projects/Sylveste/core/intercore/cmd/ic/main.go` (standard clone location)

  - ✓ Comprehensive for user manual setup
  - ⚠️ **Discrepancy**: install.sh only checks options 1–2, then falls back to clone. This is **not a bug** — install.sh is for automated bootstrap, setup.md is for manual fallback. See note below.

- **Build command**: Line 182 shows `go build -C <intercore_source_dir> -mod=readonly -o ~/.local/bin/ic ./cmd/ic` — matches install.sh ✓
- **Init/verify**: Lines 187–189 show `ic init` and `ic health` — safe commands (both idempotent or warn-only).
- **PATH check**: Line 193 shows `echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -qx "$HOME/.local/bin"` — correct pattern ✓

#### Documentation Clarity
- **Step 5b vs Step 5**: Correctly nested as "5b" (optional/fallback after 5). Structure is clear.
- **Conditional structure**: "If `ic` is not found or health check fails → build. Else → report healthy." Logic is sound.
- **Placeholders**: Line 182 uses `<intercore_source_dir>` which is clear for manual users.
- **Path warn message**: Line 195 correctly suggests the export syntax ✓

#### Consistency with install.sh
- **Source path difference**: setup.md checks `../../core/intercore`, install.sh doesn't. Reason: setup.md is for a user who may have cloned Sylveste in unexpected locations (e.g., nested subdirectories). install.sh is automated and assumes standard monorepo or one-level-deep subproject. **This is acceptable divergence** — setup.md is more defensive.
- **Init behavior**: Both acknowledge `ic init` may return non-zero if already initialized ✓
- **Health check**: Both run `ic health` to verify ✓

#### Edge Cases
- **Version string in final report** (line 197): "report 'ic kernel: healthy (version X.Y.Z)'" — suggests extracting version string, but doesn't show how. This is **fine for documentation** — users will see version in `ic health` output anyway.
- **Placeholder `<intercore_source_dir>`**: Setup.md should clarify this is replaced by the user, e.g., "e.g., `core/intercore` or `../core/intercore`". **Minor documentation improvement**, not a defect.

**Result: CLEAN — no correctness issues. Documentation clarity is good. Source path divergence with install.sh is intentional and appropriate.**

## Summary

### Overall Assessment: **CLEAN**

All three changes are correct and internally consistent:

1. **lib-intercore.sh**: Proper shell safety, correct return codes, one-time warning flag pattern is sound.
2. **install.sh**: Go version parsing and IC build logic are correct. File path detection is robust. Shell quoting and safety are excellent.
3. **setup.md**: Documentation is clear and accurate. Source path checks are more defensive than install.sh (intentional for manual users). No contradictions.

### Minor Notes (Non-blocking)

1. **setup.md ↔ install.sh source path divergence**: setup.md checks `../../core/intercore`, install.sh doesn't. This is acceptable because:
   - install.sh is for automated curl-pipe bootstrap (assumes standard paths)
   - setup.md is for manual fallback (user may have non-standard layout)
   - Not a defect; defensive design is appropriate

2. **setup.md documentation polish** (line 197): Could clarify version extraction, but output of `ic health` already shows version, so this is minor.

### Recommended Action

✓ **Approve and merge.** All changes are production-ready.
