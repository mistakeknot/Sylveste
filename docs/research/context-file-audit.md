# Context File Audit — CLAUDE.md & AGENTS.md

> Based on [arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) ("Evaluating AGENTS.md", Gloaguen et al. 2026)

## Paper's Key Findings

1. Context files **increase cost by +20%** and **reduce task success by 0.5–2%** for LLM-generated files
2. **Codebase overviews** are the primary offender — encourage broad exploration without accelerating file discovery
3. **Tool instructions** (specific commands, tools to use) DO work — 1.6× adoption when mentioned
4. **Constraints** (naming rules, security boundaries) were NOT measured by the paper
5. Context files help in **doc-poor repos** (+2.7%) but hurt in well-documented ones

## Classification Categories

| Category | Paper Verdict | Keep? | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **Constraint** | Not measured | **YES** | Naming conventions, security rules, design decisions — model would get these wrong without them |
| **Tool instruction** | Helps (1.6×) | **YES** | Build commands, test commands, publish workflows |
| **Codebase overview** | Hurts (-2%) | **TRIM** | Directory trees, component descriptions — agents have Glob/Grep/tldr-swinton |
| **Historical context** | Not measured | **MOVE** | Design rationale, past decisions — useful but may induce over-exploration |
| **Redundant content** | Hurts most | **REMOVE** | Content duplicated across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, MEMORY.md |

## Root CLAUDE.md (826 words) — Audit

| Lines | Section | Category | Verdict | Words |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1–3 | Title + description | Overview | KEEP (2 lines) | 16 |
| 5–65 | **Structure (directory tree)** | **CODEBASE OVERVIEW** | **TRIM — largest offender** | 370 |
| 67–73 | Naming Convention | Constraint | KEEP | 68 |
| 75–81 | Git Workflow | Constraint | KEEP | 47 |
| 83–87 | Working in Subprojects | Tool instruction | KEEP | 31 |
| 89–97 | Plugin Publish Policy | Tool instruction | KEEP | 63 |
| 99–101 | Critical Patterns | Tool instruction | KEEP | 21 |
| 103–105 | Plugin Design Principle | Constraint | KEEP | 32 |
| 107–112 | Security: AGENTS.md Trust Boundary | Constraint | KEEP | 60 |
| 114–119 | Security: Memory Provenance | Constraint | KEEP | 25 |
| 121–127 | Design Decisions (Do Not Re-Ask) | Constraint | KEEP | 55 |

### Findings

**45% of the root CLAUDE.md is a directory tree listing 50+ items.** This is exactly the type of content the paper identifies as the worst offender — it encourages agents to explore broadly rather than search narrowly. The agent has Glob, Grep, intermap, and tldr-swinton for navigation. The tree provides zero information the agent couldn't get from `ls` in 1 second.

**Recommendation:** Replace the 60-line directory tree with a 3-line pointer:
```
## Structure
5 pillars: os/clavain/ (OS), interverse/ (42 plugins), core/ (kernel), apps/ (TUIs), sdk/ (shared).
Each subproject has its own CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Use Glob/Grep to navigate.
```

Savings: ~350 words, ~44% of file.

## Root AGENTS.md (3,119 words) — Audit

| Lines | Section | Category | Verdict | Words |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1–5 | Overview | Overview | KEEP (compact) | 85 |
| 7–14 | Agent Quickstart | Tool instruction | KEEP | 50 |

| 389–392 | Operational Notes reference | Pointer | KEEP | 18 |

### Findings

**30% of root AGENTS.md is codebase overview** (Directory Layout table + Module Relationships graph = ~935 words). This is the exact content type the paper says hurts performance.

The Directory Layout table (50 rows) duplicates information that:
- Is already in the CLAUDE.md directory tree (so double-loaded)
- Can be discovered by `ls -la` or Glob
- Is available in each subproject's own CLAUDE.md

The Module Relationships graph is more useful (dependency info isn't discoverable via Glob), but could be condensed.

**Naming Convention** appears in both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md — redundant.

**Landing the Plane** also appears in Clavain AGENTS.md — redundant for work within Clavain.

**Recommendations:**
1. Remove Directory Layout table (save ~625 words). Replace with: "See each module's CLAUDE.md. Use `ls apps/ core/ interverse/ os/ sdk/` for directory overview."
2. Condense Module Relationships to key dependency chains only (~5 lines instead of 40)
3. Remove duplicate Naming Convention (it's in CLAUDE.md, which is always loaded)
4. Total savings: ~700-900 words, ~25% of file

## Global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (1,068 words) — Audit

| Section | Category | Verdict |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Documentation Structure | Meta | KEEP (7 lines) |
| Project Documentation Requirements | Constraint | KEEP |
| Git Workflow | Constraint | KEEP |
| Tool Usage Preferences | Constraint | KEEP |
| Collaborative Brainstorming | Constraint | KEEP |
| Oracle | Tool instruction | KEEP |
| Continuous Learning → Project Memory | Constraint | KEEP |
| Persistent Task Tracking | Constraint | KEEP |
| Claude Code Plugin Development | Tool instruction | KEEP (pointers, not content) |
| Settings Hygiene | Constraint | KEEP — prevents real bugs |
| Workflow Patterns | Pointer | KEEP |
| Running as claude-user | Conditional | KEEP |

**Verdict: Clean.** The global CLAUDE.md is 100% constraints and tool instructions. No codebase overview content. Well-structured.

---

## Subproject CLAUDE.md — Pattern Analysis (8 sampled)

### Well-structured (constraint-heavy, minimal overview):
- **Clavain** (262w): Pure constraints + quick commands. No directory tree. A+
- **interflux** (289w): Design decisions + quick commands. No directory tree. A+
- **intermap** (293w): Architecture + tool table + build commands. Compact. A
- **interpulse** (94w): Pure description + usage. Ideal. A+
- **intership** (72w): Pure function description. Ideal. A+
- **intertree** (113w): Clean overview + decisions. A

### Needs trimming (overview-heavy):
- **intercore** (1,197w): **54% is CLI quick reference** that duplicates the AGENTS.md command listing. The 8 "Quick Reference" sections (~650 words) repeat what's in the AGENTS.md. Remove from CLAUDE.md, keep only in AGENTS.md.
- **interkasten** (754w): **Architecture tree + 21-row MCP tool table** = overview. The tool table is useful but better suited for AGENTS.md. CLAUDE.md should have just build commands + design decisions.
- **autarch** (757w): **Key Paths table + Workflow Discipline** are valuable constraints. But Quick Commands section is large (200w). Acceptable.
- **interbase** (424w): SDK documentation (Go SDK, Python SDK details) is overview content better in AGENTS.md.
- **tldr-swinton** (452w): Plugin structure tree + publishing runbook. Structure tree is overview; runbook is tool instruction (keep).

---

## Subproject AGENTS.md — Pattern Analysis (3 sampled)

### Intercore AGENTS.md (2,864 words)
- Excellent comprehensive reference. CLI command tables are the RIGHT place for this content.
- Architecture tree (lines 17–61) is overview but valuable — developers need to understand 20+ internal packages.
- The full CLI command listing is tool instruction — KEEP.
- **Issue:** 100% duplicated in CLAUDE.md's quick reference sections. Fix: strip CLAUDE.md, keep AGENTS.md as single source.

### Clavain AGENTS.md (3,003 words)
- Architecture tree (lines 42–134) = **450 words of directory listing**. This is overview content.
- Component conventions (lines 175–236) = **constraint** content. KEEP.
- Modpack tables (lines 316–377) = **tool instruction** (which plugins to install). KEEP.
- Landing the Plane (lines 419–444) = duplicated from root AGENTS.md. REMOVE.
- **Recommendation:** Compress architecture tree to top-level only (~10 lines instead of 90).

### Autarch AGENTS.md (2,176 words)
- Architecture section (lines 50–89) with directory tree = overview. Could compress.
- Shared packages table (lines 91–118) = 28-row table. Useful but discoverable.
- Integration diagram (lines 249–270) = overview. Unique info (data flow) but verbose.
- Arbiter Spec Sprint (lines 296–334) = tool instruction. KEEP.
- **Most overhead is in package tables** that `go doc` or tldrs can provide.

---

## Auto-Memory MEMORY.md (3,288 words, 246 lines)

**Over the 200-line limit.** Only first 200 lines are loaded, so 46 lines of content are silently truncated.

Content breakdown:
- **Autarch patterns** (~150 lines): Detailed architecture notes, Bubble Tea gotchas, build workarounds
- **Intercore patterns** (~40 lines): Coordination, publish subsystem, seam tests
- **Interspect/Clavain bash** (~20 lines): Accumulation patterns, flock protocol
- **Shell portability** (~15 lines): Portable regex, Go build safety
- **Interverse conventions** (~10 lines): Plugin patterns
- **Intercom** (~10 lines): Container rebuild rules

**70% of MEMORY.md is Autarch-specific.** This is classic "exploration noise" — when working on interflux or interkasten, 150 lines of Bubble Tea threading model notes are pure noise.

**Recommendation:** Extract to topic files immediately:
- `autarch-learnings.md` (already referenced but apparently not fully extracted)
- `intercore-learnings.md`
- Keep MEMORY.md as a 50-line index with links

---

## Redundancy Map

Content that appears in multiple files:

| Content | Appears In | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Directory tree / structure | Root CLAUDE.md, Root AGENTS.md | Keep in AGENTS.md only (condensed) |
| Naming convention | Root CLAUDE.md, Root AGENTS.md | Keep in CLAUDE.md only |
| Landing the Plane | Root AGENTS.md, Clavain AGENTS.md | Keep in root AGENTS.md only |
| Plugin publish workflow | Root CLAUDE.md, Root AGENTS.md, Clavain AGENTS.md, each plugin CLAUDE.md | Root CLAUDE.md is authoritative; others should point there |
| Design decisions | Root CLAUDE.md, Root AGENTS.md (partially) | Keep in CLAUDE.md only |
| CLI command reference | Intercore CLAUDE.md, Intercore AGENTS.md | Keep in AGENTS.md only |
| MCP tool listing | Interkasten CLAUDE.md, Interkasten AGENTS.md | Keep in AGENTS.md, reference from CLAUDE.md |

## Scoring: Impact vs Effort

| Change | Words Saved | Risk | Effort |
|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Remove root CLAUDE.md directory tree** | ~350 | Low — agents have navigation tools | 5 min |
| **Remove root AGENTS.md directory layout table** | ~625 | Low — each module has its own docs | 10 min |
| **Condense root AGENTS.md module relationships** | ~250 | Medium — dependency info has value | 15 min |
| **Strip Intercore CLAUDE.md CLI duplication** | ~650 | Low — content stays in AGENTS.md | 10 min |
| **Compress Clavain AGENTS.md architecture tree** | ~350 | Low — top-level structure is enough | 10 min |
| **Fix MEMORY.md overflow** | ~0 (reorganize) | Low — data moves, not deleted | 20 min |
| **Remove cross-file redundancies** | ~200 | Low — keep single source | 15 min |
| **TOTAL** | **~2,425** | | ~85 min |

**Estimated token savings per session:** ~2,425 words ≈ ~3,200 tokens of context no longer processed on every turn. At our usage volume, this compounds significantly.
