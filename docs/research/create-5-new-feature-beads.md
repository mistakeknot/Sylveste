## Feature Descriptions

### iv-dl72x — F1: Audit existing Intermap MCP tools
Run all 6 tools against real Sylveste projects. Document accuracy, latency, cache behavior, and integration gaps. Produces bug list and priority recommendations.

### iv-3kz0v — F5: Write real Intermap vision and roadmap docs
Replace stub vision.md and roadmap.md with real content. Add roadmap.json for interpath aggregation.

### iv-80s4e — F6: Cross-project dependency graph MCP tool
New cross_project_deps MCP tool. Detect Go module deps, Python path deps, plugin deps. Returns structured JSON. Test against Sylveste monorepo.

### iv-dta9w — F7: Architecture pattern detection MCP tool
New detect_patterns MCP tool. Identify handler chains, middleware stacks, interface-impl pairs, MCP registrations, plugin structures. Return with confidence scores.

### iv-54iqe — F8: Live change awareness MCP tool
New live_changes MCP tool. Git-diff based change detection with structural annotation (which functions affected). Integrates with mtime cache invalidation.
