# Design: Review Agents for Autarch Autonomy Gap Analysis

Generated: 2026-02-25

## Task

Design 5 focused review agents for a strategic architecture analysis document evaluating the gap between Autarch's current human-centric TUI UX and Sylveste's vision of increasing agent autonomy through recursive rings of autonomous agencies.

The document covers 7 identified gaps, proposes a three-mode hierarchy (Executive/Supervisor/Operator), and a recursive ring model for autonomous agencies. Components involved: Autarch apps (Bigend, Gurgeh, Coldwine, Pollard), Intercore kernel (runs/phases/gates/dispatches), Clavain OS (workflow policies), and Interspect profiler.

---

## Agent Design Rationale

### Coverage Map

The document spans five distinct analytical territories, each needing a specialist lens:

1. **UX mode hierarchy** — Does the Executive/Supervisor/Operator model hold up? Are the boundaries well-defined? Does it solve the stated gaps?
2. **Autonomy architecture** — Does the recursive ring model work as a technical architecture? Is it compatible with existing Intercore/Clavain primitives?
3. **Delegation and escalation protocol** — Gap 7 (no delegation/escalation protocol) is the most operational gap. Does the analysis propose a concrete enough protocol?
4. **Migration and transition path** — Strategic analysis that ignores migration risk is incomplete. How does Autarch get from current state to the proposed future state?
5. **Vision coherence and internal consistency** — Does the document's logic hold together? Are the 7 gaps correctly identified and does the proposed model actually close them?

### Anti-overlap Assignments

- `fd-autonomy-ux-hierarchy`: Owns UX mode classification, gap-to-mode mapping, interaction model differences between modes
- `fd-recursive-ring-architecture`: Owns technical feasibility of ring model, Intercore/Clavain primitive compatibility, agency composition
- `fd-delegation-escalation-protocol`: Owns gap 7 specifically, concrete protocol design critique, exception handling flows
- `fd-migration-transition-path`: Owns migration strategy, backward compatibility, incremental rollout, existing user disruption
- `fd-vision-coherence`: Owns cross-document consistency, gap correctness, whether proposed model actually closes each gap

## Notes on Agent Design Decisions

### Why 5 agents, not 3 or 4

The document has two distinct proposal layers (UX hierarchy + ring architecture) that require independent technical review, plus three meta-concerns (escalation protocol completeness, migration viability, internal consistency). Collapsing any of these would produce a reviewer with an incoherent focus.

### Why no fd-safety or fd-correctness agents

This is a strategy document, not code. The canonical fd-safety and fd-correctness agents are designed for implementation review (race conditions, security vulnerabilities, data loss). For a document review, the equivalent concerns are:
- "Is the escalation protocol safe against loops?" → covered by fd-delegation-escalation-protocol
- "Is the ring model correct given Intercore's actual capabilities?" → covered by fd-recursive-ring-architecture

### Gap coverage map

| Gap | Primary agent | Secondary agent |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| 1. Operator vs executive UX | fd-autonomy-ux-hierarchy | fd-vision-coherence |
| 2. Tools as workflow steps vs agency rings | fd-recursive-ring-architecture | fd-vision-coherence |
| 3. Per-item vs exception-based interaction | fd-autonomy-ux-hierarchy | fd-migration-transition-path |
| 4. Chat-centric vs dashboard-centric | fd-autonomy-ux-hierarchy | — |
| 5. Single-project vs portfolio view | fd-autonomy-ux-hierarchy | fd-migration-transition-path |
| 6. Manual vs autonomous phase advancement | fd-recursive-ring-architecture | fd-migration-transition-path |
| 7. No delegation/escalation protocol | fd-delegation-escalation-protocol | fd-vision-coherence |
