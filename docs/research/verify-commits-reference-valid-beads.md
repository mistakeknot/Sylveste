- **Commits without bead IDs:** 64
- **Unique bead IDs in subject lines:** 23
- **Additional bead IDs in commit bodies:** 9 (32 total unique)
- **Beads found (recovered):** 22
- **Beads found (original):** 1
- **Beads found (recovered-doc):** 5
- **Beads found (roadmap-recovery):** 1
- **Beads found (recovered, closed as duplicate):** 1
- **MISSING from database:** 2

## Missing Beads (GAPS)

These bead IDs appear in commit messages but have **no corresponding entry** in the beads database:

| Bead ID | Commit | Context |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `iv-5zoaq` | `ab5b549` docs: add unified logging brainstorm, PRD, plan, and plugin adoption guide | Commit body: "Sprint iv-5zoaq artifacts for iv-yy1l3". Appears to be a sprint/sub-task ID for the unified logging epic (iv-yy1l3). |
| `iv-446o7.1` | `33b491c` docs: complete secret-scan remediation for all 4 repos | Commit body: "Closes: iv-446o7.1". Sub-task .1 of iv-446o7; note that iv-446o7.2 exists as a recovered bead but .1 does not. |

### Additional Beads from Commit Bodies (9 IDs)

| Bead ID | Status | Recovery Type | Title |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `iv-3wmf2` | EXISTS | recovered-doc | Intermap Python Sidecar |
| `iv-446o7.1` | **MISSING** | -- | Secret-scan remediation sub-task (referenced in "Closes: iv-446o7.1") |
| `iv-5zoaq` | **MISSING** | -- | Unified logging sprint ID (referenced as "Sprint iv-5zoaq artifacts") |
| `iv-6dqrj` | EXISTS | recovered-doc | Review Quality Feedback Loop |

## Recovery Quality Assessment

### All recovered beads share these characteristics:
- **Created date:** 2026-02-27 (recovery date, not original creation)
- **Owner:** mistakeknot (generic recovery owner)
- **Priority:** P4 (default placeholder priority)
- **Description:** "Recovered placeholder bead created from git commit metadata after Beads data loss"
- **External link:** Git commit SHA linking back to the originating commit

### The one original bead (`iv-ynbh`) differs:
- **Created:** 2026-02-15 (pre-dates the loss window)
- **Owner:** mk (actual owner)
- **Priority:** P3 (manually triaged)
- **Description:** Full context with problem statement, solution outline, and references
- **Type:** feature (not generic task)

This contrast highlights the information loss in recovered beads: original priority, owner, type, creation date, and detailed descriptions are all lost.

## Recommendations

1. **Create beads for the 2 missing IDs:**
   - `iv-5zoaq` -- Sprint task for unified logging (iv-yy1l3). Context: commit `ab5b549`.
   - `iv-446o7.1` -- Secret-scan remediation sub-task, sibling of iv-446o7.2. Context: commit `33b491c`. Should likely be marked CLOSED since the commit says "Closes: iv-446o7.1".

2. **Audit recovered bead metadata:** The 22 recovered beads all have P4/task/OPEN status. Some (like `iv-1xtgd` "shell hardening complete" and `iv-brcmt`) should be CLOSED based on commit context. Consider a pass to update status from commit semantics.

3. **64 commits lack bead IDs entirely.** Many are chore/docs/fix commits that may not need tracking, but some (`feat(security): add secret-scanning baseline rollout toolkit`, `docs: implementation plan for Interverse plugin decomposition (38 tasks)`) represent significant work without bead linkage.
