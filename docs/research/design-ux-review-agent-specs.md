# Agent Specs: Autarch UX Review

## Analysis Summary

Before the agent specs, this section captures the key architectural and UX facts
discovered during analysis. It informs why the five agents are shaped as they are.

### What exists today

**Unified TUI** (`internal/tui/`): 5 tabs — Bigend, Gurgeh, Coldwine, Sprint, Pollard.
Tab switching via slash commands (/bigend, /gurgeh, etc.) or Ctrl+Left/Right cycling.
Ctrl+P opens the command palette. A Sprint tab was added as a 5th tab alongside the
canonical 4, creating a documentation–reality gap (AGENTS.md says "exactly 4 tabs").

**Onboarding** (`internal/tui/onboarding.go`): 9 states (Kickoff → ScanVision/Problem/Users
→ Interview → SpecSummary → EpicReview → TaskReview → Complete). ScanVision/ScanProblem/ScanUsers
exist as defined states but do NOT appear in the canonical ordered list returned by
AllOnboardingStates() — they are latent/orphaned. The interview has 8 substeps. Completion
lands at OnboardingComplete with ID "dashboard" — onboarding is entirely housed inside Gurgeh,
not the shell, which means other tabs are inaccessible during onboarding. OnboardingCompleteMsg
is a no-op in the shell (handled in Gurgeh).

**Command palette** (`internal/tui/palette.go`): Single injected command list per tab switch
(SetCommands updated via updateCommands()). Max 8 results shown. Non-broadcast commands
execute locally; broadcast commands go through Target → Confirm phases. Targets are agent
runtimes (Claude/Codex/Gemini), NOT tools or kernel concepts.

**Bigend** (`internal/tui/views/bigend.go`): Tasks + Sessions panes in 2-col (width≥80) or
stacked layout. Agency logic delegated to autarch.Client (ListSessions/CreateSession) and
optional intercore.Client (DispatchList). Local focus state (FocusSessions/FocusTasks) with
F3 toggle. Chat is third pane. Coldwine tab has a dispatch key `d` — single-letter hotkey
that AGENTS.md prohibits during typing.

**Gurgeh** (`internal/tui/views/gurgeh.go`): Onboarding-first or direct browser. Main UX is
Sidebar (spec list + status icons) + Spec Details + Chat. "Generate Epics" emits SpecHandoffMsg
to Coldwine — but the user must manually switch tabs; no auto-navigation occurs. Agency logic
is delegated to autarch.Client; arbiter execution is outside this view but the oracle review
found ArbiterView holds a coordinator it doesn't use, and RunTargetedScan is a no-op.

**Coldwine** (`internal/tui/views/coldwine.go`): 3-pane shell, task navigation. Dispatch (`d`)
triggers Intercore run creation. Intercore integration is conditional — if absent, users get
planning but no execution path. Agency logic: local planning CRUD against autarch.Client then
Intercore dispatch. Some agency logic (epic/task state machine) lives in the TUI view, not OS.

**Pollard** (`internal/tui/views/pollard.go`): Sidebar (hunter statuses or insight list) +
document pane (insight details) + chat. "Run Research" in palette calls coordinator.StartRun
with hardcoded hunters (competitor-tracker, hackernews-trendwatcher, github-scout). "Link
Insight" links to a spec. No mechanism to surface research findings proactively to Bigend or
Gurgeh while on another tab.

**Sprint tab** (`internal/tui/views/sprint_view.go`): A 5th tab not mentioned in most docs.
Surfaces Intercore run/dispatch/event state — the closest thing to "pure kernel rendering".

### Key gaps vs vision

1. **Onboarding locks the user into Gurgeh**: Other tabs unreachable during the 8-substep
   interview. No progress indicator visible in the tab bar.

2. **Cross-tool handoffs require manual tab switches**: Gurgeh→Coldwine emits SpecHandoffMsg
   but user must switch manually. Pollard findings don't surface proactively to Gurgeh/Bigend.

3. **Agency logic in the wrong layer**: Coldwine task/epic state machine and dispatch wiring
   are TUI-layer code. Gurgeh arbiter logic (confidence scoring, phase consistency) has
   duplicate implementations. Vision says this should live in Clavain (OS).

4. **Kernel capabilities not surfaced**: Sprint tab surfaces Intercore state but Bigend (the
   primary monitoring view) only shows tasks+sessions, not run/dispatch/event state from the
   kernel. Users can't see kernel phase/gate/budget state without switching to Sprint.

5. **Discoverability fragmentation**: Tab switching relies on slash commands (chat input
   focus required), Ctrl+left/right cycling (no visual affordance), or clicking — mixing
   paradigms. Palette commands update per-tab but there's no cross-tab navigation command in
   the palette.

6. **Sprint tab exists but isn't in the tab naming convention**: AGENTS.md lists 4 tools;
   Sprint is a 5th. The merge-sprint-into-coldwine PRD (2026-02-25) plans to resolve this.

7. **ScanVision/Problem/Users states are orphaned**: Defined in onboarding.go but excluded
   from AllOnboardingStates(). If these represent quick-scan integration points (Pollard
   feeding into Gurgeh interview), they're dead code masking a missing capability.

8. **Swallowed errors on critical paths**: Intermute Start() errors dropped; scan/research
   errors not surfaced. Users see silent failures as empty data rather than actionable errors.

## Design Rationale

### Why these five agents

The five focus areas map directly to the five review dimensions in the task brief:

| Agent | Task Brief Dimension |
|---|---|
| fd-ux-onboarding-friction | (1) UX friction in the onboarding flow |
| fd-ux-cross-tool-composition | (3) whether the four tools compose into a coherent product experience |
| fd-ux-kernel-surface-gap | (4) where the TUI fails to make kernel/OS capabilities accessible |
| fd-ux-agency-layer-leak | (2) tab switching / cross-tool navigation + layer violations |
| fd-ux-vision-delivery-gap | (5) gaps between vision docs and what the TUI actually delivers |

Note: dimension (2) "tab switching and cross-tool navigation" is split between
fd-ux-cross-tool-composition (the handoff UX) and fd-ux-agency-layer-leak (the architectural
coupling that makes clean handoffs impossible). This is intentional — the navigation friction
has two distinct root causes that require different reviewers.
