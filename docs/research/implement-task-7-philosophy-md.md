# Task 7: Update PHILOSOPHY.md with OODARC Vocabulary — Implementation Analysis

## Task Summary

Added an "OODARC Lens" subsection to PHILOSOPHY.md, placed as a subsection (`###`) under "The Core Bet" (`##`), immediately after line 26 ("If any of these claims is wrong, the project is misguided.") and before the `---` separator that precedes "Receipts Close Loops".

## What Was Done

1. **Read PHILOSOPHY.md** (122 lines) to identify the exact insertion point.
2. **Inserted the OODARC Lens section** (12 new lines) using the Edit tool, replacing the transition between "The Core Bet" and "Receipts Close Loops" with the new section plus the original separator.
3. **Verified** the file reads correctly — the new section flows naturally as a subsection of "The Core Bet" and the rest of the document is unchanged.
4. **Committed** as `docs: add OODARC vocabulary to PHILOSOPHY.md` (commit `c5ef9ce`).

## Insertion Point Details

- **Before:** Line 26 ended "The Core Bet" with "If any of these claims is wrong, the project is misguided." followed by a `---` separator and "## Receipts Close Loops".
- **After:** The OODARC Lens subsection (`### The OODARC Lens`) sits between the closing sentence of "The Core Bet" and the `---` separator. This makes it a logical sub-topic of the core bet, labeling the flywheel with OODARC vocabulary.

## Content Added

The section covers:
- **Definition:** OODARC = Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Reflect — the flywheel restated as a cognitive loop.
- **Three nested timescales:** per-turn (agent actions), per-sprint (phase gates), cross-session (Interspect learning).
- **Why Reflect matters:** AI agents don't implicitly learn; the Reflect phase makes learning explicit and durable.
- **Epistemic hygiene warning:** Situation assessments are prompt aids, not ground truth.

## Structural Fit

The OODARC Lens section uses `###` heading level (subsection of `## The Core Bet`), which is appropriate because:
- It elaborates on the flywheel already introduced in the core bet section
- It doesn't introduce a new top-level principle — it provides vocabulary for an existing one
- The three-timescale breakdown maps directly to the four claims in "The Core Bet"

## File State

- **File:** `/home/mk/projects/Sylveste/PHILOSOPHY.md`
- **New line count:** 134 lines (was 122, +12)
- **Commit:** `c5ef9ce` on `main`
- **No other files modified.**
