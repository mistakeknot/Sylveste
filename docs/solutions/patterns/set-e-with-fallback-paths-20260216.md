# `set -euo pipefail` with Fallback Recovery Paths

## Problem

A Claude Code hook (`post-task.sh`) needs to INSERT into SQLite, but if the DB is locked or unavailable, it must fall back to appending to a JSONL file. The quality review flagged `set -u` as too loose — the script should use `set -euo pipefail` for strictness.

But adding `set -e` causes the script to exit immediately when `sqlite3` returns non-zero, skipping the fallback logic entirely.

## Wrong Pattern

```bash
set -euo pipefail

sqlite3 "$DB" "INSERT ..." >/dev/null 2>&1
insert_status=$?  # NEVER REACHED — set -e already exited

if [ "$insert_status" -ne 0 ]; then
  # fallback to JSONL — NEVER REACHED
fi
```

## Correct Pattern

```bash
set -euo pipefail

insert_status=0
sqlite3 "$DB" "INSERT ..." >/dev/null 2>&1 || insert_status=$?

if [ "$insert_status" -ne 0 ]; then
  # fallback to JSONL — works correctly
fi
```

The `|| insert_status=$?` captures the exit code while satisfying `set -e` — the compound command as a whole succeeds (the `||` branch always returns 0 from the assignment).

## Alternative: Subshell Isolation

For more complex fallback logic, isolate the risky command in a subshell:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

if ! (sqlite3 "$DB" "INSERT ..." >/dev/null 2>&1); then
  # fallback path
fi
```

## Key Lesson

When using `set -euo pipefail` with commands that must be allowed to fail (for fallback logic), always use `|| variable=$?` or `if !` to prevent premature exit. Initialize the status variable before the command so the fallback condition works even if the command never runs.
