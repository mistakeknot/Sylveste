# Import the issue rows a merge actually brought in, rather than all 3,810.
#
# `bd import` on the whole file takes ~49s here. The script this replaced
# avoided that by filtering to new-or-newer rows before importing — but it
# filtered by reimplementing bd's staleness rule, which is precisely the
# duplication that was worth retiring.
#
# So the filter is cheap and dumb instead: git already knows which lines this
# merge changed, and every issue is exactly one line. We hand bd the changed
# rows and bd still decides, row by row, whether each one may be applied. The
# guarantee stays bd's; only the size of the batch is ours.
#
# It used to degrade to nearly a full import on exactly the merges it was
# written for. The two databases disagreed about dependencies[].created_by on
# 3,589 of 3,657 shared rows, so every export that alternated machines rewrote
# ~3,300 beads and the filter had ~3,300 rows to hand over. Measured 3 rows on a
# same-machine merge and 3,313 on a cross-machine one.
#
# Repaired in Sylveste-zpeh by reconciling the field in both databases — not, as
# first believed, by stopping bd from stamping the importing actor, which it
# does not do. A cross-machine merge now hands over 7 rows for one changed bead:
# 6 of residual data anomalies (Sylveste-keb3) plus the bead that changed.
#
# When it cannot tell what changed, it imports everything. Slow beats wrong:
# an import that silently skips a machine's work is the failure this whole
# path exists to prevent.
#
# Usage: beads-import-merged.sh [<before-ref>]      (default: ORIG_HEAD)
