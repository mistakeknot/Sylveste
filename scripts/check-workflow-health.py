"""Report workflows that exist but cannot fire.

GitHub disables a workflow with a `schedule:` trigger after 60 days of
repository inactivity, and a disabled workflow does not run on push either. On
2026-07-28 this had silently switched off `secret-scan.yml` — the check standing
between a leaked credential and GitHub — on **17 of 36** plugin repos. Every one
showed a clean history of 100 successful runs and then simply stopped.

That is the same defect as a workflow whose inputs do not exist on a runner: it
is present, correct, reviewed, and not actually checking anything. The only
difference is that the platform turned this one off rather than the repo layout.

Also flags workflows that have never produced a single run — one that has never
executed is indistinguishable from one that is broken.

Exit 0 = every workflow in every repo can fire, and every repo answered.
Exit 1 = at least one is disabled or has never run.
Exit 2 = could not inspect, or could not inspect enough of the estate to speak
         for it — never confused with "all clear". That distinction was a claim
         this file made and did not keep until 2026-08-07; see the reachability
         floor at the bottom of main() for what it looked like when it broke.
