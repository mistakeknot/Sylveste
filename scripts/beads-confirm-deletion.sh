# Record that a bead was deleted on purpose, so the other machine deletes it too.
#
# This is the answer to the auto-export's question. When a bead exists in
# .beads/issues.jsonl but not in Dolt, two situations look identical:
#
#   another machine's work, pulled but never imported  -> import it
#   deleted here on purpose                            -> confirm it
#
# Answering the second with a bare `bd export` drops the row from the file and
# loses the *intent*. The other machine then sees only an absence, which is not
# a deletion signal (a filtered export, or work not yet exported, looks the
# same), keeps its copy, and writes the bead back on its next export. The
# deletion silently undoes itself.
#
# So the intent is written down, in an append-only git-tracked ledger, and
# committed in the same commit as the export that acts on it. Split across two
# commits, a machine can pull the export without the ledger and resurrect the
# bead in the window between.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/beads-confirm-deletion.sh <id> [<id>...]        # already deleted here
#   scripts/beads-confirm-deletion.sh --delete-local <id>   # delete here too

# Refuse if the local database is behind the shared file.

# This script exports, and an export writes the local database over the file —
# so any bead the file has and this database lacks is destroyed by it. That is
# the whole reason beads-auto-export.sh refuses in this state, and the first
# version of this script bypassed that guard by calling `bd export` directly.
#
# Caught by a probe: zklw's import had been killed mid-flight, so its database
# was missing five beads that were on main. Confirming ONE deletion there
# exported a file with six beads gone, including the bead tracking this very
# work. It was on an unmerged branch, so nothing was lost — but that is luck,
# not design.
#
# The beads being confirmed are expected to be missing locally. Anything else
# missing is another machine's work, and this stops rather than guessing.
