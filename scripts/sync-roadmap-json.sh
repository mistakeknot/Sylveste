# sync-roadmap-json.sh — generate docs/roadmap.json and docs/backlog.md.
#
# THIS IS A SHIM. The generator lives in interpath.
#
# Two copies of this script existed for four months and diverged. Remontoire's
# README already assigned ownership — "Beads owns backlog truth [...] Interpath
# owns generated roadmap artifacts" — but the monorepo kept its own fork, so
# which output you got depended on which script had run:
#
#   /interpath:roadmap  ->  plugin copy   (2026-03-08)
#   the LaunchAgent     ->  this copy     (2026-07-10)
#
# The plugin copy counted all 18 deferred beads as open work (481 -> 499),
# hardcoded blocked_by to [] and so dropped 127 dependency edges, emitted a
# timestamp that is malformed on macOS (%:z is GNU-only), and produced no
# backlog.md at all. Those fixes now live in interpath and this file delegates,
# so there is one generator and one place to fix it.
#
# INTERFACE PRESERVED: $1 = roadmap json path, $2 = backlog markdown path,
# both defaulting under docs/. The com.arouth.sylveste-roadmap LaunchAgent
# calls this path with explicit arguments and needs no change.
