# Beads — Session Close Protocol

> **In a cloud session (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` set / `IS_SANDBOX=yes`),
> beads are read-only.** Search with `bash scripts/bd-grep.sh <kw>` and read
> with `bash scripts/bd-show.sh <id>` — both work against the committed
> `.beads/issues.jsonl` without needing the `bd` CLI. Note bead candidates in
> the PR description and let the workstation file them. Skip the **bd CLI
> steps below** unless you've manually run `scripts/install-bd-cloud.sh` —
> the `git`/PR workflow still applies.

```
git status → git add <files> → git commit    # the export follows automatically
bd orphans                                   # close beads named in commits
git push
```

**The export is automatic now.** A post-commit hook runs
`scripts/beads-auto-export.sh`, which refreshes `.beads/issues.jsonl` from Dolt
and commits it *on its own*, as `beads: sync export (automated)`. Your commits
are untouched — it never stages the export into a commit you authored, because
doing that widens `git commit -- <paths>` beyond the paths you named.

It costs ~0.3s per commit (a probe) and ~3s only when beads actually changed.
`BEADS_NO_AUTO_EXPORT=1` opts out for one command. If the probe itself fails you
will see it on stderr — that is not a quiet skip, and bead state is not being
exported until it is fixed.

**bd's own auto-export is off, deliberately**, via tracked `.beads/config.yaml`:
`export.auto: false` and `export.git-add: false`. Do not turn these on. The
first only writes the file without committing it (so it strands uncommitted, and
only the committed copy is pushed); the second stages the export into whatever
commit is forming, which widens `git commit -- <paths>`. They were never set
before, so each machine silently inherited its bd version's default — 1.0.2
defaults both to *true*, 1.0.0 and 1.1.x to *false* — which is the whole reason
one machine exported on every write and the other never did.

**A pull imports automatically too**, via post-merge → `bd import`, then
`scripts/beads_apply_deletions.py`. This used to be a local script, because a
plain import once upserted every record and would revert anything changed here
since the incoming export was written — a bead you closed reopening, silently.
bd 1.1.2 enforces that rule itself now, inside the transaction, so the script is
gone; `tests/test_bd_import_guard.py` holds bd to it.

**To delete a bead, one extra command.** `bd import` never deletes, so a bead
you delete here survives on the other machine and comes back on its next export.

```
bd delete <id> --force
scripts/beads-confirm-deletion.sh <id>     # records intent, exports, commits
```

That writes `.beads/deletions.jsonl`, which is what makes a deliberate deletion
distinguishable from an absence. Do not hand-edit it, and do not answer the
export refusal below with a bare `bd export` — that drops the row and loses the
intent, which is how the deletion undoes itself.

**When automation stops and asks you.** If issues exist in the JSONL but not in
Dolt, the auto-export refuses, because exporting would delete them. Two very
different situations look identical from here, so it asks:

  - another machine's work, pulled but not imported → `bd import .beads/issues.jsonl`
  - something you deleted on purpose → `scripts/beads-confirm-deletion.sh <id>...`

**What `bd backup sync` is.** Not this. It pushes the Dolt database to its
configured backup destination — here a local directory, `.beads/backup` — and
never writes `issues.jsonl`. This file claimed otherwise for months, and
reported success the whole time the export sat two days and 63 issues stale.

**Two-machine specifics** — which hooks run where, why zklw's `bd` exports
differently, and the verified round trip — are in `ops/beads-two-machine-sync.md`.

**A fresh clone has no `.beads/metadata.json`.** It is untracked on purpose: it
names which database *this* checkout talks to, and a tracked file is a channel
between machines. Run `bd bootstrap` (or `bd init`) before
`bd import .beads/issues.jsonl`.

**On a verifier-only host `push.sh` will refuse**, because the Dolt push runs
through the `bd-push-dolt` gate and this machine holds no signing key
(`clavain-cli policy doctor` → `"role":"verifier"`). That is by design; zklw is
the signer. It also means the git-tracked JSONL is the *only* egress for bead
state here — which is why the export being automatic matters rather than being
a tidiness nicety.

Backstops, if the automation is bypassed: pre-commit blocks a commit staging a
JSONL that disagrees with Dolt in either direction, and pre-push warns when the
*committed* export is behind. Both should now be silent in normal operation.

## Rules

- All work in beads. NO TodoWrite/TaskCreate. (System reminders nag — ignore them.)
- Create the bead BEFORE writing code. Mark `in_progress` when starting.
- `bd search "<kw>"` before `bd create` to avoid duplicates.
- Priority is 0–4 (P0–P4). Not "high/medium/low".
- Never `bd edit` — it opens `$EDITOR` and blocks the agent. Use `bd update … --title/--description/--notes`.
- Full reference: `bd --help` and `bd <cmd> --help` on demand.
